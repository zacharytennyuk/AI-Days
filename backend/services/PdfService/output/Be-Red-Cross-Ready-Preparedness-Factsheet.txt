Get a kit Make a plan
At a minimum, have the basic supplies listed below.
Keep supplies in an easy-to-carry emergency preparedness
kit that you can use at home or take with you in case you must evacuate.
• Water: one gallon per person, per day (3-day supply for
evacuation, 2-week supply for home)  • Food: non-perishable, easy-to-prepare items (3-day supply for evacuation, 2-week supply for home)  • Flashlight  • Battery-powered or hand-crank radio (NOAA Weather Radio, if possible)  • Extra batteries   • First aid kit  • Medications (7-day supply) and medical items    • Multi-purpose tool  • Sanitation and personal hygiene items   • Copies of personal documents (medication list and pertinent medical information, proof of address, deed/lease to home, passports, birth certificates, insurance policies)  • Current digital photos of loved ones, updated every six months, especially for children  • Cell phone with chargers  • Family and emergency contact information  • Extra cash  • Emergency blanket  • Map(s) of the area
Consider the needs of all family members and add supplies to
your kit.

Suggested items to help meet additional needs are:
• Medical supplies (hearing aids with extra batteries, glasses,
contact lenses, syringes, cane)  • Baby supplies (bottles, formula, baby food, diapers)  • Games and activities for children  • Pet supplies (collar, leash, ID, food, carrier, bowl)  • Two-way radios   • Extra set of car keys and house keys  • Manual can opener
Additional supplies to keep at home or in your kit based on
the types of disasters common to your area:
• Whistle  • N95 or surgical masks  • Matches  • Rain gear
• Towels  • Work gloves  • Tools/supplies for securing your home   • Extra clothing, hat and sturdy shoes  • Plastic sheeting  • Duct tape  • Scissors  • Household liquid bleach  • Entertainment items   • Blankets or sleeping bags • Sunscreen • Insect Repellent• Meet with your family or household members.
• Discuss how to prepare and respond to emergencies that  are most likely to happen where you live, learn, work and play.
• Identify responsibilities for each member of your household  and plan to work together as a team.
• If a family member is in the military or engages in extended business travel on a regular basis, plan how you would  respond if they were away.
• If you or a member of your household is an individual with access or functional needs, including a disability, consider developing a comprehensive evacuation plan in advance with family, care providers and care attendants, as appropriate. Complete a personal assessment of functional abilities and possible needs during and after an emergency or disaster situation, and create a personal support network to assist.
Plan what to do in case you are separated during an emergency
• Choose two places to meet—
1. Right outside your home in case of a sudden emergency,
such as a fire.
2. Outside your neighborhood, in case you cannot return  home or are asked to evacuate.
Consider any transportation challenges that might be encountered by individuals that use mobility assistive equipment.
• Choose an out-of-area emergency contact person. It may
be easier to text or call long distance if local phone lines are overloaded or out of service.

Everyone should memorize emergency contact information and have it in writing or programmed into their cell phones.
• Identify alternative ways to communicate (email, text, call,  mail, through a third party, etc).
Plan what to do if you have to evacuate
• Decide where you would go and what route you would take to
get there. You may choose to go to a hotel or motel, stay with friends or relatives in a safe location or go to an evacuation shelter if necessary.
For more information on disaster and emergency preparedness, visit redcross.org. Be Informed
Learn what disasters or emergencies may occur in your area.
These events can range from those affecting only you and your
family, like a home fire or medical emergency, to those affecting your entire community, like an earthquake or flood.
Let Your Family Know You’re Safe
Tell your loved ones about the American Red Cross Safe and Well Website or access through redcross.org by searching safe
and well. This internet-based tool should be integrated into your emergency communications plan. People within a disaster-
affected area can register themselves as “safe and well” and concerned family and friends who know the person’s phone number
or address can search for messages posted by those who self-register. If you don’t have internet access, call 1-800-RED CROSS
to register yourself and your family. • Identify how local authorities will notify you during a disaster
and how you will get information, whether through local radio,
TV or NOAA Weather Radio stations or channels.
• Know the difference between different weather alerts such as
“watches” and “warnings” and what actions to take in each.
• Know what actions to take to protect yourself during disasters that may occur in areas where you travel or have moved
recently. For example, if you travel to a place where earthquakes
are common and you are not familiar with them, make sure you
know what to do to protect yourself should one occur.
• When a major disaster occurs, your community can change in an instant. Loved ones may be hurt and emergency response is
likely to be delayed. Make sure that at least one member of your
household is trained in first aid and CPR and knows how to use
an automated external defibrillator (AED).

This training is useful in many emergency situations.
• Share what you have learned with your family, household and
neighbors and encourage them to be informed too.
Emergency Contact Cards for All Household Members
142108 9/16
• Print one card for each family member.
• Write the contact information for each household
member, such as work, school and cell phone numbers.
• Ensure contacts for relatives include familiar names  (grandma, aunt, etc.) as well as actual names when  making cards for children.
• Fold the card so it fits in your pocket, wallet or purse.
• Carry the card with you so it is available in the event of  a disaster or other emergency.Download the Red Cross Emergency App or,  go to redcross.org and search emergency app.
Get your cards online here or, go to
redcross.org and search emergency contact.This app provides expert advice on how to prepare and respond to disasters and includes a map with open Red  Cross shelters.
• Have at least one alternate location if the preferred location  is not accessible.
• Practice evacuating your home twice a year. Drive your planned evacuation route and plot alternate routes on your map in case roads are impassable. Ensure all household/family members know the evacuation route, alternate routes, primary and alternate meeting destination.
• Plan ahead for your pets. Keep a phone list of “pet friendly” motels/hotels and animal shelters that are along your evacuation routes.
