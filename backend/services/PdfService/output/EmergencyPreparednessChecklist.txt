Escape Plan
n a fire or other emergency, you
may need to evacuate your house,
apartment or mobile home on a
moment’s notice. You should be
ready to get out fast.
Develop an escape plan by drawing a floor
plan of your residence. Using a black or blue
pen, show the location of doors, windows,
stairways, and large furniture. Indicate the
location of emergency supplies (Disaster
Supplies Kit), fire extinguishers, smoke
detectors, collapsible ladders, first aid kits
and utility shut off points.

Next, use a
colored pen to draw a broken line charting
at least two escape routes from each room.
Finally, mark a place outside of the home
where household members should meet in
case of fire.
Be sure to include important points outside
such as garages, patios, stairways,
elevators, driveways and porches. If your
home has more than two floors, use an
additional sheet of paper. Practice
emergency evacuation drills with all
household members at least two times
each year.Emergency Plan
