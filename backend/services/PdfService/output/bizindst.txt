INTRODUCTION. A hurricane blasts through South Florida causing
more than $25 billion in damages.
A fire at a food processing plant results in 25 deaths, a company out of
business and a small town devastated.
A bombing in the World Trade Center results in six deaths, hundreds of injuries
and the evacuation of 40,000 people.
A blizzard shuts down much of the East Coast for days. More than 150 lives are
lost and millions of dollars in damages incurred.INTRODUCTION
Every year emergencies take
their toll on business and industry— in lives and dollars. But some-thing can be done. Business andindustry can limit injuries anddamages and return more quicklyto normal operations if they planahead.
About This Guide
This guide provides step-by-
step advice on how to create andmaintain a comprehensive emer-gency management program. Itcan be used by manufacturers, cor-porate offices, retailers, utilities orany organization where a sizablenumber of people work or gather.
Whether you operate from a
high-rise building or an industrialcomplex; whether you own, rentor lease your property; whetheryou are a large or small company;the concepts in this guide willapply.
To begin, you need not have
in-depth knowledge of emergencymanagement.

What you need isthe authority to create a plan anda commitment from the chiefexecutive officer to make emer-gency management part of yourcorporate culture.
If you already have a plan, use
this guide as a resource to assessand update your plan.The guide is organized as follows:
Section 1: 4 Steps in the
Planning Process — how to form a
planning team; how to conduct avulnerability analysis; how todevelop a plan; and how to imple-ment the plan. The informationcan be applied to virtually any typeof business or industry.
Section 2 :  Emergency Management
Considerations — how to build
such emergency management capabilities as life safety, propertyprotection, communications andcommunity outreach.
Section 3 :  Hazard-Specific
Information — technical informa-
tion about specific hazards yourfacility may face.
Section 4: Information Sources
— where to turn for additionalinformation.
What Is an Emergency?
An emergency is any un-
planned event that can causedeaths or significant injuries toemployees, customers or the public; or that can shut down yourbusiness, disrupt operations, causephysical or environmental damage, or threaten the facility’sfinancial standing or public image.
PAGE 5
Obviously, numerous events can
be “emergencies,” including:
• Fire• Hazardous materials incident• Flood or flash flood• Hurricane• Tornado• Winter storm• Earthquake• Communications failure• Radiological accident• Civil disturbance• Loss of key supplier or customer• Explosion
The term “disaster” has been
left out of this document becauseit lends itself to a preconceivednotion of a large-scale event, usu-ally a “natural disaster.”  In fact,each event must be addressedwithin the context of the impact ithas on the company and the com-munity. What might constitute anuisance to a large industrial facil-ity could be a “disaster” to a smallbusiness.
What Is Emergency
Management?
Emergency management is the
process of preparing for, mitigat-ing, responding to and recoveringfrom an emergency.
Emergency management is a
dynamic process. Planning,though critical, is not the onlycomponent. Training, conductingdrills, testing equipment and coor-dinating activities with the com-munity are other important func-tions.

Making the “Case”
for EmergencyManagement
To be successful, emergency
management requires upper management support. The chiefexecutive sets the tone by autho-rizing planning to take place anddirecting senior management toget involved.
When presenting the “case” for
emergency management, avoiddwelling on the negative effects of an emergency (e.g., deaths,fines, criminal prosecution) andemphasize the positive aspects ofpreparedness. For example:
• It helps companies fulfill their
moral responsibility to protectemployees, the community andthe environment.
• It facilitates compliance with
regulatory requirements ofFederal, State and local agencies.
• It enhances a company’s ability
to recover from financial losses,regulatory fines, loss of marketshare, damages to equipment or products or business interrup-tion.
• It reduces exposure to civil or
criminal liability in the event ofan incident.
• It enhances a company’s image
and credibility with employees,customers, suppliers and thecommunity.
• It may reduce your insurance
premiums.

Here’s one example of a planning team.Form the Team
The size of the planning team
will depend on the facility’s opera-tions, requirements and resources.Usually involving a group of people is best because:
• It encourages participation and
gets more people invested inthe process.
• It increases the amount of time
and energy participants are ableto give.
• It enhances the visibility and
stature of the planning process.
• It provides for a broad perspec-
tive on the issues.
Determine who can be an
active member and who can servein an advisory capacity. In mostcases, one or two people will bedoing the bulk of the work.

Atthe very least, you should obtaininput from all functional areas.Remember:
• Upper management• Line management• Labor• Human Resources• Engineering and maintenance• Safety, health and environmen-
tal affairs• Public information officer
• Security• Community relations• Sales and marketing• Legal• Finance and purchasing
Have participants appointed in
writing by upper management.
Their job descriptions could
also reflect this assignment.ESTABLISH A PLANNING TEAM .There must be an individual
or group in charge of developing the emergency management plan. The follow-ing is guidance for making the appointment.ESTABLISH

PAGE 10Establish a Schedule
and Budget
Establish a work schedule and
planning deadlines. Timelinescan be modified as prioritiesbecome more clearly defined.
Develop an initial budget for
such things as research, printing,seminars, consulting services andother expenses that may be neces-sary during the developmentprocess.Establish Authority
Demonstrate management’s
commitment and promote anatmosphere of cooperation by“authorizing” the planning groupto take the steps necessary todevelop a plan. The group shouldbe led by the chief executive orthe plant manager.
Establish a clear line of authori-
ty between group members andthe group leader, though not sorigid as to prevent the free flow ofideas.
Issue a Mission
Statement
Have the chief executive or
plant manager issue a missionstatement to demonstrate thecompany’s commitment to emer-gency management.

The state-ment should:
• Define the purpose of the plan
and indicate that it will involvethe entire organization
• Define the authority and struc-
ture of the planning group
Review Internal Plans
and Policies
Documents to look for include:
• Evacuation plan• Fire protection plan• Safety and health program• Environmental policies• Security procedures• Insurance programs• Finance and purchasing
procedures
• Plant closing policy• Employee manuals• Hazardous materials plan• Process safety assessment• Risk management plan• Capital improvement program• Mutual aid agreementsMeet with Outside
Groups
Meet with government agen-
cies, community organizations andutilities. Ask about potentialemergencies and about plans andavailable resources for respondingto them. Sources of informationinclude:
• Community emergency
management office
• Mayor or Community
Administrator’s office
• Local Emergency Planning
Committee  (LEPC)
• Fire Department• Police Department• Emergency Medical Services
organizations
• American Red Cross• National Weather Service• Public Works Department• Planning Commission• Telephone companies• Electric utilities• Neighboring businessesANALYZE CAPABILITIES AND HAZARDS. This step
entails gathering information about current capabilities and about possible hazards and emergencies, and then conducting a vulnerability analysis to determine the facility’s capabilities for handling emergencies.S T E P  2
ANALYZE
CAPABILITIESAND HAZARDS
PAGE 11WHERE DO YOU STAND RIGHT NOW?
While researching potential emer-
gencies, one facility discovered thata dam — 50 miles away — posed athreat to its community.

The facili-ty was able to plan accordingly.
PAGE 12Identify Internal
Resources andCapabilities
Resources and capabilities that
could be needed in an emergencyinclude:
• Personnel — fire brigade, haz-
ardous materials response team,emergency medical services,security, emergency manage-ment group, evacuation team,public information officer
• Equipment — fire protection
and suppression equipment,communications equipment,first aid supplies, emergencysupplies, warning systems,emergency power equipment,decontamination equipment
• Facilities — emergency operat-
ing center, media briefing area,shelter areas, first-aid stations,sanitation facilities
• Organizational capabilities —
training, evacuation plan,employee support system
• Backup systems — arrange-
ments with other facilities toprovide for:
uPayroll
uCommunications
uProduction
uCustomer services
uShipping and receiving
uInformation systems support
uEmergency power
uRecovery supportIdentify Codes and
Regulations
Identify applicable Federal,
State and local regulations suchas:
• Occupational safety and health
regulations
• Environmental regulations• Fire codes• Seismic safety codes• Transportation regulations• Zoning regulations• Corporate policies
Identify Critical
Products, Servicesand Operations
You’ll need this information to
assess the impact of potentialemergencies and to determine theneed for backup systems. Areas toreview include:
• Company products and services
and the facilities and equip-ment needed to produce them
• Products and services provided
by suppliers, especially solesource vendors
• Lifeline services such as electri-
cal power, water, sewer, gas,telecommunications and trans-portation
• Operations, equipment and
personnel vital to the contin-ued functioning of the facilityOne way to increase response
capabilities is to identify employeeskills (medical, engineering, communications, foreign lan-guage) that might be needed in anemergency.
Identify External
Resources
There are many external
resources that could be needed inan emergency.

In some cases, for-mal agreements may be necessaryto define the facility’s relationshipwith the following:
• Local emergency management
office
• Fire Department• Hazardous materials response
organization
• Emergency medical services• Hospitals• Local and State police• Community service organiza-
tions
• Utilities• Contractors• Suppliers of emergency
equipment
• Insurance carriers
PAGE 13Do an Insurance
Review
Meet with insurance carriers to
review all policies. (See Section 2:Recovery and Restoration.)
PAGE 14CONDUCT A VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
•Geographic — What can hap-
pen as a result of the facility’slocation? Keep in mind:
uProximity to flood plains,
seismic faults and dams
uProximity to companies thatproduce, store, use or trans-port hazardous materials
uProximity to major trans-portation routes and airports
uProximity to nuclear powerplants
•Technological — What could
result from a process or systemfailure? Possibilities include:
uFire, explosion, hazardous
materials incident
uSafety system failure
uTelecommunications failure
uComputer system failure
uPower failure
uHeating/cooling system failure
uEmergency notification system failure
•Human Error — What emer-
gencies can be caused byemployee error? Are employeestrained to work safely? Do theyknow what to do in an emer-gency?
Human error is the single
largest cause of workplaceemergencies and can resultfrom:
uPoor training
uPoor maintenance
uCarelessness
uMisconduct
uSubstance abuse
uFatigueThe next step is to assess the
vulnerability of your facility —the probability and potentialimpact of each emergency. Usethe Vulnerability Analysis Chartin the appendix section to guidethe process, which entails assign-ing probabilities, estimatingimpact and assessing resources,using a numerical system. Thelower the score the better.
List Potential
Emergencies
In the first column of the chart,
list all emergencies that couldaffect your facility, including thoseidentified by your local emergencymanagement office.

Considerboth:
• Emergencies that could occur
within your facility
• Emergencies that could occur
in your community
Below are some other factors to
consider.
•Historical — What types of
emergencies have occurred inthe community, at this facilityand at other facilities in thearea?
uFires
uSevere weather
uHazardous material spills
uTransportation accidents
uEarthquakes
uHurricanes
uTornadoes
uTerrorism
uUtility outages
•Physical — What types of
emergencies could result fromthe design or construction ofthe facility? Does the physicalfacility enhance safety?Consider:
uThe physical construction of
the facility
uHazardous processes orbyproducts
uFacilities for storing com-bustibles
uLayout of equipment
uLighting
uEvacuation routes and exits
uProximity of shelter areas
•Regulatory — What emergen-
cies or hazards are you regulatedto deal with?
Analyze each potential emer-
gency from beginning to end.Consider what could happen as aresult of:
uProhibited access to the
facility
uLoss of electric power
uCommunication lines down
uRuptured gas mains
uWater damage
uSmoke damage
uStructural damage
uAir or water contamination
uExplosion
uBuilding collapse
uTrapped persons
uChemical releaseEstimate Probability
In the Probability column, rate
the likelihood of each emergency’soccurrence. This is a subjectiveconsideration, but useful nonethe-less.
Use a simple scale of 1 to 5 with
1 as the lowest probability and 5 asthe highest.
Assess the Potential
Human Impact
Analyze the potential human
impact of each emergency — thepossibility of death or injury.
Assign a rating in the Human
Impact column of theVulnerability Analysis Chart. Usea 1 to 5 scale with 1 as the lowestimpact and 5 as the highest.
Assess the Potential
Property Impact
Consider the potential property
for losses and damages. Again,assign a rating in the PropertyImpact column, 1 being the lowest impact and 5 being thehighest.

Consider:
• Cost to replace• Cost to set up temporary
replacement
• Cost to repair

PAGE 16If the answers are yes, move on
to the next assessment. If theanswers are no, identify what canbe done to correct the problem.For example, you may need to:
• Develop additional emergency
procedures
• Conduct additional training• Acquire additional equipment• Establish mutual aid agree-
ments
• Establish agreements with
specialized contractors
Add the Columns
Total the scores for each emer-
gency. The lower the score thebetter. While this is a subjectiverating, the comparisons will helpdetermine planning and resourcepriorities — the subject of thepages to follow.Assess the Potential
Business Impact
Consider the potential loss of
market share. Assign a rating inthe Business Impact column.Again, 1 is the lowest impact and5 is the highest. Assess theimpact of:
• Business interruption• Employees unable to report to
work
• Customers unable to reach
facility
• Company in violation of
contractual agreements
• Imposition of fines and
penalties or legal costs
• Interruption of critical supplies• Interruption of product
distribution
Assess Internal and
External Resources
Next assess your resources and
ability to respond. Assign a scoreto your Internal Resources andExternal Resources. The lowerthe score the better.
To help you do this, consider
each potential emergency frombeginning to end and eachresource that would be needed torespond.

For each emergency askthese questions:
• Do we have the needed
resources and capabilities torespond?
• Will external resources be able
to respond to us for this emer-gency as quickly as we mayneed them, or will they haveother priority areas to serve?When assessing resources, remem-
ber that community emergencyworkers — police, paramedics, fire-fighters — will focus their responsewhere the need is greatest. Or theymay be victims themselves and be unable to respond immediately.That means response to your facili-ty may be delayed.
Your plan should include the
following basic components.
Executive Summary
The executive summary gives
management a brief overview of:
• The purpose of the plan• The facility’s emergency
management policy
• Authorities and responsibilities
of key personnel
• The types of emergencies that
could occur
• Where response operations will
be managedEmergency
Management Elements
This section of the plan briefly
describes the facility’s approach tothe core elements of emergencymanagement, which are:
• Direction and control• Communications• Life safety• Property protection• Community outreach• Recovery and restoration• Administration and logistics
These elements, which are
described in detail in Section 2, arethe foundation for the emergencyprocedures that your facility willfollow to protect personnel andequipment and resume operations.DEVELOP THE PLAN. You are now ready to develop an emergency
management plan.

This section describes how.S T E P 3
DEVELOP
THEPLAN
PAGE 17PLAN COMPONENTS
Support Documents
Documents that could be
needed in an emergency include:
•Emergency call lists —  lists
(wallet size if possible) of allpersons on and off site whowould be involved in respond-ing to an emergency, theirresponsibilities and their 24-hour telephone numbers
•Building and site maps that
indicate:
uUtility shutoffs
uWater hydrants
uWater main valves
uWater lines
uGas main valves
uGas lines
uElectrical cutoffs
uElectrical substations
uStorm drains
uSewer lines
uLocation of each building
(include name of building,street name and number)
uFloor plans
uAlarm and enunciators
uFire extinguishers
uFire suppression systems
uExits
uStairways
uDesignated escape routes
uRestricted areas
uHazardous materials (includ-ing cleaning supplies andchemicals)
uHigh-value items
•Resource lists — lists of major
resources (equipment, supplies,services) that could be neededin an emergency; mutual aidagreements with other compa-nies and government agenciesEmergency Response
Procedures
The procedures spell out how
the facility will respond to emer-gencies.

Whenever possible,develop them as a series of check-lists that can be quickly accessedby senior management, depart-ment heads, response personneland employees.
Determine what actions would
be necessary to:
• Assess the situation• Protect employees, customers,
visitors, equipment, vitalrecords and other assets, partic-ularly during the first three days
• Get the business back up and
running
Specific procedures might be
needed for any number of situa-tions such as bomb threats or tor-nadoes, and for such functions as :
• Warning employees and
customers
• Communicating with personnel
and community responders
• Conducting an evacuation and
accounting for all persons inthe facility
• Managing response activities• Activating and operating an
emergency operations center
• Fighting fires• Shutting down operations• Protecting vital records• Restoring operations
PAGE 18Some facilities are required to
develop:
nEmergency escape procedures
and routes
nProcedures for employees who
perform or shut down critical oper-ations before an evacuation
nProcedures to account for all
employees, visitors and contractorsafter an evacuation is completed
nRescue and medical duties for
assigned employees
nProcedures for reporting emer-
gencies
nNames of persons or depart-
ments to be contacted for informa-tion regarding the planIn an emergency, all personnelshould know:  1. What is my role?2. Where should I go?
The following is guidance for
developing the plan.
Identify Challenges
and PrioritizeActivities
Determine specific goals and
milestones. Make a list of tasks tobe performed, by whom and when.Determine how you will addressthe problem areas and resourceshortfalls that were identified inthe vulnerability analysis.
Write the Plan
Assign each member of the
planning group a section to write.Determine the most appropriateformat for each section.
Establish an aggressive timeline
with specific goals. Provideenough time for completion ofwork, but not so much as to allowassignments to linger. Establish aschedule for:
• First draft• Review• Second draft• Tabletop exercise• Final draft• Printing• DistributionEstablish a Training
Schedule
Have one person or department
responsible for developing a train-ing schedule for your facility.

Forspecific ideas about training, referto Step 4.
Coordinate with
Outside Organizations
Meet periodically with local
government agencies and commu-nity organizations. Inform appro-priate government agencies thatyou are creating an emergencymanagement plan. While theirofficial approval may not berequired, they will likely havevaluable insights and informationto offer.
Determine State and local
requirements for reporting emer-gencies, and incorporate theminto your procedures.
Determine protocols for turn-
ing control of a response over tooutside agencies. Some detailsthat may need to be worked outare:
• Which gate or entrance will
responding units use?
• Where and to whom will they
report?
• How will they be identified?• How will facility personnel
communicate with outsideresponders?
• Who will be in charge of
response activities?
Determine what kind of identi-
fication authorities will require toallow your key personnel into yourfacility during an emergency.
PAGE 19THE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
Your emergency planning priori-
ties may be influenced by govern-ment regulation. To remain incompliance you may be requiredto address specific emergencymanagement functions that mightotherwise be a lower priorityactivity for that given year.Determine the needs of disabledpersons and non-English-speakingpersonnel. For example, a blindemployee could be assigned apartner in case an evacuation isnecessary.
The Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) defines a disabledperson as anyone who has a physi-cal or mental impairment thatsubstantially limits one or moremajor life activities, such as see-ing, hearing, walking, breathing,performing manual tasks, learn-ing, caring for oneself or working.
PAGE 20Seek Final Approval
Arrange a briefing for the chief
executive officer and senior man-agement and obtain writtenapproval.
Distribute the Plan
Place the final plan in three-
ring binders and number all copiesand pages.

Each individual whoreceives a copy should be requiredto sign for it and be responsible forposting subsequent changes.
Determine which sections of
the plan would be appropriate toshow to government agencies(some sections may refer to corpo-rate secrets or include private list-ings of names, telephone numbersor radio frequencies).
Distribute the final plan to:
• Chief executive and senior
managers
• Key members of the company’s
emergency response organiza-tion
• Company headquarters• Community emergency
response agencies (appropriatesections)
Have key personnel keep a
copy of the plan in their homes.
Inform employees about the
plan and training schedule.Maintain Contact with
Other CorporateOffices
Communicate with other
offices and divisions in your com-pany to learn:
• Their emergency notification
requirements
• The conditions where mutual
assistance would be necessary
• How offices will support each
other in an emergency
• Names, telephone numbers and
pager numbers of key personnel
Incorporate this information
into your procedures.
Review, Conduct
Training and Revise
Distribute the first draft to
group members for review. Reviseas needed.
For a second review, conduct a
tabletop exercise with manage-ment and personnel who have akey emergency managementresponsibility. In a conferenceroom setting, describe an emer-gency scenario and have partici-pants discuss their responsibilitiesand how they would react to thesituation. Based on this discus-sion, identify areas of confusionand overlap, and modify the planaccordingly.Consolidate emergency plans for
better coordination.

Stand-aloneplans, such as a Spill PreventionControl and Countermeasures(SPCC) plan, fire protection planor safety and health plan, shouldbe incorporated into one compre-hensive plan.
Emergency planning must
become part of the corporate culture.
Look for opportunities to build
awareness; to educate and trainpersonnel; to test procedures; toinvolve all levels of management,all departments and the communi-ty in the planning process; and tomake emergency managementpart of what personnel do on aday-to-day basis.
Test how completely the plan
has been integrated by asking:
• How well does senior manage-
ment support the responsibili-ties outlined in the plan?
• Have emergency planning con-
cepts been fully incorporatedinto the facility’s accounting,personnel and financial proce-dures?
• How can the facility’s processes
for evaluating employees anddefining job classifications bet-ter address emergency manage-ment responsibilities?• Are there opportunities for dis-
tributing emergency prepared-ness information through cor-porate newsletters, employeemanuals or employee mailings?
• What kinds of safety posters or
other visible reminders wouldbe helpful?
• Do personnel know what they
should do in an emergency?
• How can all levels of the orga-
nization be involved in evaluat-ing and updating the plan?IMPLEMENT THE PLAN. Implementation means more than simply
exercising the plan during an emergency. It means acting on recommendationsmade during the vulnerability analysis, integrating the plan into company oper-ations, training employees and evaluating the plan.S T E P 4

THE PLAN
PAGE 21INTEGRATE THE PLAN INTO COMPANY OPERATIONS
PAGE 22Training Activities
Training can take many forms:
•Orientation and Education
Sessions — These are regularly
scheduled discussion sessions toprovide information, answerquestions and identify needsand concerns.
•Tabletop Exercise — Members
of the emergency managementgroup meet in a conferenceroom setting to discuss theirresponsibilities and how theywould react to emergency sce-narios. This is a cost-effectiveand efficient way to identifyareas of overlap and confusionbefore conducting moredemanding training activities.
•Walk-through Drill — The
emergency management groupand response teams actuallyperform their emergencyresponse functions.

This activ-ity generally involves morepeople and is more thoroughthan a tabletop exercise.
•Functional Drills — These
drills test specific functionssuch as medical response, emer-gency notifications, warningand communications proce-dures and equipment, thoughnot necessarily at the sametime. Personnel are asked toevaluate the systems and iden-tify problem areas.Everyone who works at or visits
the facility requires some form oftraining. This could include peri-odic employee discussion sessionsto review procedures, technicaltraining in equipment use foremergency responders, evacuationdrills and full-scale exercises.Below are basic considerations fordeveloping a training plan.
Planning
Considerations
Assign responsibility for devel-
oping a training plan. Considerthe training and informationneeds for employees, contractors,visitors, managers and those withan emergency response role iden-tified in the plan.
Determine for a 12 month
period:
• Who will be trained• Who will do the training• What training activities will be
used
• When and where each session
will take place
• How the session will be evalu-
ated and documented
Use the Training Drills and
Exercises Chart in the appendixsection to schedule training activ-ities or create one of your own.
Consider how to involve com-
munity responders in trainingactivities.
Conduct reviews after each
training activity. Involve bothpersonnel and community respon-ders in the evaluation process.CONDUCT TRAINING
•Evacuation Drill — Personnel
walk the evacuation route to adesignated area where proce-dures for accounting for all per-sonnel are tested.

Participantsare asked to make notes as theygo along of what might becomea hazard during an emergency,e.g., stairways cluttered withdebris, smoke in the hallways.Plans are modified accordingly.
•Full-scale Exercise — A real-
life emergency situation is simulated as closely as possible.This exercise involves companyemergency response personnel,employees, management andcommunity response organizations.Employee Training
General training for all employ-
ees should address:
• Individual roles and responsi-
bilities
• Information about threats,
hazards and protective actions
• Notification, warning and com-
munications procedures
• Means for locating family
members in an emergency
• Emergency response procedures• Evacuation, shelter and
accountability procedures
• Location and use of common
emergency equipment
• Emergency shutdown
procedures
The scenarios developed during
the vulnerability analysis canserve as the basis for trainingevents.

PAGE 24In addition to a yearly audit,
evaluate and modify the plan atthese times:
• After each training drill or
exercise
• After each emergency• When personnel or their
responsibilities change
• When the layout or design of
the facility changes
• When policies or procedures
change
Remember to brief personnel
on changes to the plan.Conduct a formal audit of the
entire plan at least once a year.Among the issues to consider are:
• How can you involve all levels
of management in evaluatingand updating the plan?
• Are the problem areas and
resource shortfalls identified inthe vulnerability analysis beingsufficiently addressed?
• Does the plan reflect lessons
learned from drills and actualevents?
• Do members of the emergency
management group and emer-gency response team under-stand their respective responsi-bilities?, Have new membersbeen trained?
• Does the plan reflect changes
in the physical layout of thefacility? Does it reflect newfacility processes?
• Are photographs and other
records of facility assets up todate?
• Is the facility attaining its train-
ing objectives?
• Have the hazards in the facility
changed?
• Are the names, titles and tele-
phone numbers in the plan current?
• Are steps being taken to incor-
porate emergency managementinto other facility processes?
• Have community agencies and
organizations been briefed onthe plan? Are they involved inevaluating the plan?When siting a new location, con-
duct a hazard analysis of the area.Modify your plan when a new sitebecomes operable. EVALUATE AND MODIFY THE PLAN

FUNCTION
PAGE 27DIRECTION AND CONTROL. Someone must be in charge in an emer-
gency. The system for managing resources, analyzing information and makingdecisions in an emergency is called direction and control.
The direction and control system described below assumes a facility of
sufficient size.

Your facility may require a less sophisticated sys tem, though
the principles described here will still apply.
The configuration of your sys-
tem will depend on many factors.Larger industries may have theirown fire team, emergency medicaltechnicians or hazardous materialsteam, while smaller organizationsmay need to rely on mutual aidagreements. They may also beable to consolidate positions orcombine responsibilities. Tenantsof office buildings or industrialparks may be part of an emergencymanagement program for theentire facility.
Emergency
Management Group(EMG)
The EMG is the team responsi-
ble for the big picture. It controlsall incident-related activities. The Incident Commander (IC)oversees the technical aspects ofthe response.
The EMG supports the IC by
allocating resources and by inter-facing with the community, themedia, outside response organiza-tions and regulatory agencies.The EMG is headed by the
Emergency Director (ED), whoshould be the facility manager.The ED is in command and con-trol of all aspects of the emer-gency.

Other EMG membersshould be senior managers whohave the authority to:
• Determine the short- and long-
term effects of an emergency
• Order the evacuation or
shutdown of the facility
• Interface with outside organiza-
tions and the media
• Issue press releases
The relationship between the
EMG and the IC is shown inFigure 1.DIRECTION

PAGE 28Incident Command
System (ICS)
The ICS was developed specifi-
cally for the fire service, but itsprinciples can be applied to allemergencies.

The ICS providesfor coordinated response and aclear chain of command and safeoperations.
The Incident Commander (IC)
is responsible for front-line man-agement of the incident, for tacti-cal planning and execution, fordetermining whether outside assis-tance is needed and for relayingrequests for internal resources oroutside assistance through theEmergency Operations Center(EOC).
The IC can be any employee,
but a member of managementwith the authority to make deci-sions is usually the best choice.
The IC must have the capabili-
ty and authority to:
• Assume command
• Assess the situation• Implement the emergency
management plan
• Determine response strategies• Activate resources• Order an evacuation• Oversee all incident response
activities
• Declare that the incident is “over”Emergency Operations
Center (EOC)
The EOC serves as a central-
ized management center for emer-gency operations. Here, decisionsare made by the EMG based uponinformation provided by the ICand other personnel. Regardlessof size or process, every facilityshould designate an area wheredecision makers can gather duringan emergency.
The EOC should be located in
an area of the facility not likely tobe involved in an incident, per-haps the security department, themanager’s office, a conferenceroom or the training center. Analternate EOC should be designat-ed in the event that the primarylocation is not usable.
Each facility must determine its
requirements for an EOC basedupon the functions to be per-formed and the number of peopleinvolved. Ideally, the EOC is adedicated area equipped withcommunications equipment, refer-ence materials, activity logs andall the tools necessary to respondquickly and appropriately to anemergency.
EOC Resources:
nCommunications equipment
n  A copy of the emergency
management plan and EOCprocedures
nBlueprints, maps, status boards
nA list of EOC personnel and
descriptions of their duties
nTechnical information and data
for advising responders
nBuilding security system
information
nInformation and data manage-
ment capabilities
nTelephone directories
nBackup power, communica-
tions and lighting
nEmergency suppliesIn a hazardous materials accident,an off-site medic was exposed tothe spilled material and requiredhospitalization.

It was determinedthat the person was able to enterthe hazardous area unprotectedbecause no one among a host ofmanagers and facility responderswas “in charge” at the scene.
PAGE 29Planning
Considerations
To develop a direction and
control system:
• Define the duties of personnel
with an assigned role. Establishprocedures for each position.Prepare checklists for all proce-dures.
• Define procedures and respon-
sibilities for fire fighting, med-ical and health, and engineer-ing.
• Determine lines of succession
to ensure continuous leader-ship, authority and responsibili-ty in key positions.
• Determine equipment and sup-
ply needs for each responsefunction.
• At a minimum, assign all
personnel responsibility for:
uRecognizing and reporting an
emergency
uWarning other employees inthe area
uTaking security and safetymeasures
uEvacuating safely
• Provide training.Security
Isolation of the incident scene
must begin when the emergency isdiscovered. If possible, the discov-erer should attempt to secure thescene and control access, but noone should be placed in physicaldanger to perform these functions.
Basic security measures include:
• Closing doors or windows• Establishing temporary barriers
with furniture after people havesafely evacuated
• Dropping containment materi-
als (sorbent pads, etc.) in thepath of leaking materials
• Closing file cabinets or desk
drawers
Only trained personnel should
be allowed to perform advancedsecurity measures. Access to thefacility, the EOC and the incidentscene should be limited to personsdirectly involved in the response.
Coordination of
Outside Response
In some cases, laws, codes, prior
agreements or the very nature ofthe emergency require the IC toturn operations over to an outsideresponse organization.
When this happens, the proto-
cols established between the facili-ty and outside response organiza-tions are implemented. The facili-ty’s IC provides the community’sIC a complete report on the situation.
The facility IC keeps track of
which organizations are on-siteand how the response is beingcoordinated.

This helps increasepersonnel safety and accountabili-ty, and prevents duplication ofeffort.Keep detailed logs of actions
taken during an emergency.Describe what happened, deci-sions made and any deviationsfrom policy. Log the time foreach event.
COMMUNICATIONS
PAGE 31FUNCTIONCOMMUNICATIONS. Communications are essential to any
business operation. A communications failure can be a disaster in itself, cutting off vital business activities.Communications are needed to report emergencies, to warn personnel of thedanger, to keep families and off-duty employees informed about what’s happen-ing at the facility to coordinate response actions and to keep in contact with customers and suppliers.
Contingency Planning
Plan for all possible contingen-
cies from a temporary or short-term disruption to a total commu-nications failure.
• Consider the everyday func-
tions performed by your facilityand the communications, bothvoice and data, used to supportthem.
• Consider the business impact if
your communications wereinoperable. How would thisimpact your emergency opera-tions?
• Prioritize all facility communi-
cations. Determine whichshould be restored first in anemergency.
• Establish procedures for restor-
ing communications systems.
• Talk to your communications
vendors about their emergencyresponse capabilities. Establishprocedures for restoring services.
• Determine needs for backup
communications for each busi-ness function.

Options includemessengers, telephones,portable microwave, amateurradios, point-to-point privatelines, satellite, high-frequencyradio.Emergency
Communications
Consider the functions your
facility might need to perform inan emergency and the communi-cations systems needed to supportthem.
Consider communications
between:
• Emergency responders• Responders and the Incident
Commander (IC)
• The IC and the Emergency
Operations Center (EOC)
• The IC and employees• The EOC and outside response
organizations
• The EOC and neighboring
businesses
• The EOC and employees’
families
• The EOC and customers• The EOC and media
PAGE 32Methods of communication
include:
• Messenger • Telephone • T wo-way radio • FAX machine• Microwave• Satellite• Dial-up modems• Local area networks• Hand signals
Family
Communications
In an emergency, personnel will
need to know whether their fami-lies are okay. Taking care of one’sloved ones is always a first priority.
Make plans for communicating
with employees’ families in anemergency.
Also, encourage employees to:
• Consider how they would com-
municate with their families incase they are separated fromone another or injured in anemergency.
• Arrange for an out-of-town
contact for all family membersto call in an emergency.
• Designate a place to meet fami-
ly members in case they cannotget home in an emergency.
Notification
Establish procedures for
employees to report an emergency.Inform employees of procedures.Train personnel assigned specificnotification tasks.
Post emergency telephone
numbers near each telephone, onemployee bulletin boards and inother prominent locations.Maintain an updated list of
addresses and telephone and pagernumbers of key emergencyresponse personnel (from withinand outside the facility).
Listen for tornado, hurricane
and other severe weather warningsissued by the National WeatherService.
Determine government agen-
cies’ notification requirements inadvance.

Notification must bemade immediately to local gov-ernment agencies when an emer-gency has the potential to affectpublic health and safety.
Prepare announcements that
could be made over public addresssystems.
Warning
Establish a system for warning
personnel of an emergency. Thesystem should:
• Be audible or within view by all
people in the facility
• Have an auxiliary power supply• Have a distinct and recogniz-
able signal
Make plans for warning persons
with disabilities. For instance, aflashing strobe light can be used to warn hearing-impaired people.
Familiarize personnel with
procedures for responding whenthe warning system is activated.
Establish procedures for
warning customers, contractors,visitors and others who may notbe familiar with the facility’swarning system.
Test your facility’s warning
system at least monthly.Test communications often. A
research firm discovered in a drillthat its two-way radio system didnot work, limiting communica-tions between the EmergencyOperating Center (EOC) and theIncident Commander (IC) to a single telephone line. TheEmergency Management Grouphad failed to provide a backupradio for the EOC. Fortunately,this was discovered during training.
Test alarm systems monthly. Onecompany conducted its first test ofa sophisticated alarm system 21years after the system wasinstalled. Rather than alarm bells,the system played Christmasmusic.
LIFE SAFETY. Protecting the health and safety of everyone in the
facility is the first priority during an emergency.LIFE
SAFETY
PAGE 33FUNCTION
Evacuation Planning
One common means of protec-
tion is evacuation. In the case offire, an immediate evacuation to apredetermined area away from thefacility may be necessary. In ahurricane, evacuation couldinvolve the entire community andtake place over a period of days.
To develop an evacuation poli-
cy and procedure:
• Determine the conditions
under which an evacuationwould be necessary.
• Establish a clear chain of com-
mand. Identify personnel withthe authority to order an evacu-ation. Designate “evacuationwardens” to assist others in anevacuation and to account forpersonnel.
• Establish specific evacuation
procedures.

Establish a systemfor accounting for personnel.Consider employees’ trans-portation needs for community-wide evacuations.
• Establish procedures for assist-
ing persons with disabilities andthose who do not speakEnglish. • Post evacuation procedures.
• Designate personnel to contin-
ue or shut down critical opera-tions while an evacuation isunderway. They must be capa-ble of recognizing when toabandon the operation andevacuate themselves.
• Coordinate plans with the local
emergency management office.
Evacuation Routes and
Exits
Designate primary and sec-
ondary evacuation routes andexits. Have them clearly markedand well lit. Post signs.
Install emergency lighting in
case a power outage occurs duringan evacuation.
Ensure that evacuation routes
and emergency exits are:
• Wide enough to accommodate
the number of evacuating personnel
• Clear and unobstructed at all
times
• Unlikely to expose evacuating
personnel to additional hazards
Have evacuation routes evalu-
ated by someone not in your organization.Consider how you would access
important personal informationabout employees (home phone,next-of-kin, medical) in an emer-gency. Storing information oncomputer disks or in sealedenvelopes are two options.
PAGE 34Assembly Areas and
Accountability
Obtaining an accurate account
of personnel after a site evacua-tion requires planning and practice.
• Designate assembly areas where
personnel should gather afterevacuating.
• Take a head count after the
evacuation. The names andlast known locations of person-nel not accounted for should bedetermined and given to theEOC. (Confusion in theassembly areas can lead tounnecessary and dangeroussearch and rescue operations.)
• Establish a method for account-
ing for non-employees such assuppliers and customers.
• Establish procedures for further
evacuation in case the incidentexpands.

This may consist ofsending employees home bynormal means or providingthem with transportation to anoff-site location.
Shelter
In some emergencies, the best
means of protection is to takeshelter either within the facility oraway from the facility in a publicbuilding.
• Consider the conditions for
taking shelter, e.g., tornadowarning.
• Identify shelter space in the
facility and in the community.Establish procedures for send-ing personnel to shelter.
• Determine needs for emergency
supplies such as water, food andmedical supplies.• Designate shelter managers, if
appropriate.
• Coordinate plans with local
authorities.
Training and
Information
Train employees in evacuation,
shelter and other safety proce-dures. Conduct sessions at leastannually or when:
• Employees are hired• Evacuation wardens, shelter
managers and others with spe-cial assignments are designated
• New equipment, materials or
processes are introduced
• Procedures are updated or
revised
• Exercises show that employee
performance must be improved
Provide emergency information
such as checklists and evacuationmaps.
Post evacuation maps in strate-
gic locations.
Consider the information needs
of customers and others who visitthe facility.
Family Preparedness
Consider ways to help employ-
ees prepare their families for emer-gencies. This will increase theirpersonal safety and help the facili-ty get back up and running.Those who are prepared at homewill be better able to carry outtheir responsibilities at work. Search and rescue should be con-
ducted only by properly trainedand equipped professionals. Deathor serious injury can occur whenuntrained employees reenter adamaged or contaminated facility.A gas explosion and fire in a nurs-ing home caused the evacuationof all patients, most of whom weredisabled. Because the staff hadtrained for this scenario, allpatients were evacuated safely.
Planning
Considerations
Establish procedures for:
• Fighting fires• Containing material spills• Closing or barricading doors
and windows
• Shutting down equipment• Covering or securing
equipment
• Moving equipment to a safe
location
Identify sources of backup
equipment, parts and supplies.
Designate personnel to autho-
rize, supervise and perform a facili-ty shutdown.

Train them to rec-ognize when to abandon theeffort.
Obtain materials to carry out
protection procedures and keepthem on hand for use only inemergencies.Protection Systems
Determine needs for systems to
detect abnormal situations, pro-vide warning and protect property.Consider:
• Fire protection systems• Lightning protection systems• Water-level monitoring systems• Overflow detection devices• Automatic shutoffs• Emergency power generation
systems
Consult your property insurer
about special protective systems.
Mitigation
Consider ways to reduce the
effects of emergencies, such as mov-ing or constructing facilities awayfrom flood plains and fault zones.Also consider ways to reduce thechances of emergencies fromoccurring, such as changingprocesses or materials used to runthe business.PROPERTY PROTECTION.
Protecting facilities, equipment and vital
records is essential to restoring operations once an emergency has occurred.

PROPERTY
PROTECTION
PAGE 35FUNCTION
PAGE 36Consider physical retrofitting
measures such as:
• Upgrading facilities to with-
stand the shaking of an earth-quake or high winds
• “Floodproofing” facilities by
constructing flood walls orother flood protection devices(see Section 3 for additionalinformation)
• Installing fire sprinkler systems• Installing fire-resistant materi-
als and furnishing
• Installing storm shutters for all
exterior windows and doors
There are also non-structural
mitigation measures to consider,including:
• Installing fire-resistant materi-
als and furnishing
• Securing light fixtures and
other items that could fall orshake loose in an emergency
• Moving heavy or breakable
objects to low shelves
• Attaching cabinets and files to
low walls or bolting themtogether
• Placing Velcro strips under
typewriters, tabletop computersand television monitors
• Moving work stations away
from large windows
• Installing curtains or blinds
that can be drawn over win-dows to prevent glass fromshattering onto employees
• Anchoring water heaters and
bolting them to wall studs
Consult a structural engineer orarchitect and your community’s
building and zoning offices foradditional information.
Facility Shutdown
Facility shutdown is generally a
last resort but always a possibility.Improper or disorganized shut-down can result in confusion,injury and property damage.
Some facilities require only
simple actions such as turning offequipment, locking doors andactivating alarms. Others requirecomplex shutdown procedures.
Work with department heads to
establish shutdown procedures.Include information about whenand how to shut off utilities.Identify:
• The conditions that could
necessitate a shutdown
• Who can order a shutdown• Who will carry out shutdown
procedures
• How a partial shutdown would
affect other facility operations
• The length of time required for
shutdown and restarting
Train personnel in shutdown
procedures.

Post procedures.
PAGE 37Records Preservation
Vital records may include:
• Financial and insurance infor-
mation
• Engineering plans and drawings• Product lists and specifications • Employee, customer and suppli-
er databases
• Formulas and trade secrets• Personnel files
Preserving vital records is
essential to the quick restorationof operations. Analyzing vitalrecords involves:
1. Classifying operations into
functional categories, e.g.,finance, production, sales,administration
2. Determining essential functions
for keeping the business up andrunning, such as finance, pro-duction, sales, etc.
3. Identifying the minimum infor-
mation that must be readilyaccessible to perform essentialfunctions, e.g., maintainingcustomer collections mayrequire access to account state-ments
4. Identifying the records that
contain the essential informa-tion and where they are located
5. Identifying the equipment and
materials needed to access anduse the informationNext, establish procedures for
protecting and accessing vitalrecords. Among the manyapproaches to consider are:
• Labeling vital records• Backing up computer systems• Making copies of records• Storing tapes and disks in
insulated containers
• Storing data off-site where they
would not likely be damaged byan event affecting your facility
• Increasing security of computer
facilities
• Arranging for evacuation of
records to backup facilities
• Backing up systems handled by
service bureaus
• Arranging for backup power
COMMUNITY
OUTREACH
PAGE 39FUNCTION
Involving the
Community
Maintain a dialogue with com-
munity leaders, first responders,government agencies, communityorganizations and utilities, includ-ing:
• Appointed and elected leaders• Fire, police and emergency
medical services personnel
• Local Emergency Planning
Committee (LEPC) members
• Emergency management
director
• Public Works Department• American Red Cross• Hospitals• Telephone company• Electric utility• Neighborhood groups
Have regular meetings with
community emergency personnelto review emergency plans andprocedures. Talk about whatyou’re doing to prepare for andprevent emergencies.

Explainyour concern for the community’swelfare.
Identify ways your facility could
help the community in a commu-nity-wide emergency.Look for common interests and
concerns. Identify opportunitiesfor sharing resources and informa-tion.
Conduct confidence-building
activities such as facility tours.Do a facility walk-through withcommunity response groups.
Involve community fire, police
and emergency management per-sonnel in drills and exercises.
Meet with your neighbors to
determine how you could assisteach other in an emergency.
Mutual Aid
Agreements
To avoid confusion and conflict
in an emergency, establish mutualaid agreements with local responseagencies and businesses.
These agreements should:
• Define the type of assistance • Identify the chain of command
for activating the agreement
• Define communications
procedures
Include these agencies in facili-
ty training exercises wheneverpossible.COMMUNITY OUTREACH. Your facility’s relationship with the commu-
nity will influence your ability to protect personnel and property and return tonormal operations. This section describes ways to involve outside organizations in the emergencymanagement plan.
Mutual aid agreements can
address any number of activities orresources that might be needed inan emergency. For example:
nProviding for firefighting and
HAZMAT response.
n  Providing shelter space, emer-
gency storage, emergency supplies,medical support.
nBusinesses allowing neighbors
to use their property to accountfor personnel after an evacuation.
PAGE 40Community Service
In community-wide emergen-
cies, business and industry areoften needed to assist the commu-nity with:
• Personnel• Equipment• Shelter• Training• Storage• Feeding facilities• EOC facilities• Food, clothing, building
materials
• Funding• Transportation
While there is no way to pre-
dict what demands will be placedon your company’s resources, givesome thought to how the commu-nity’s needs might influence yourcorporate responsibilities in anemergency.

Also, consider theopportunities for community ser-vice before an emergency occurs.Public Information
When site emergencies expand
beyond the facility, the communi-ty will want to know the nature ofthe incident, whether the public’ssafety or health is in danger, whatis being done to resolve the prob-lem and what was done to preventthe situation from happening.
Determine the audiences that
may be affected by an emergencyand identify their informationneeds. Include:
• The public• The media• Employees and retirees• Unions• Contractors and suppliers• Customers• Shareholders• Emergency response
organizations
• Regulatory agencies• Appointed and elected officials• Special interest groups • NeighborsThe community wants to know:
nWhat does the facility do?
nWhat are the hazards?
nWhat programs are in place to
respond to emergencies?
nHow could a site emergency
affect the community?
nWhat assistance will be
required from the community?
PAGE 41Media Relations
In an emergency, the media are
the most important link to thepublic. Try to develop and main-tain positive relations with mediaoutlets in your area. Determinetheir particular needs and inter-ests.

Explain your plan for pro-tecting personnel and preventingemergencies.
Determine how you would
communicate important publicinformation through the media inan emergency.
• Designate a trained spokes-
person and an alternate
spokesperson
• Set up a media briefing area• Establish security procedures• Establish procedures for ensur-
ing that information is com-plete, accurate and approvedfor public release
• Determine an appropriate and
useful way of communicatingtechnical information
• Prepare background informa-
tion about the facilityWhen providing information to
the media during an emergency:
Do’s
• Give all media equal access to
information.
• When appropriate, conduct
press briefings and interviews.Give local and national mediaequal time.
• Try to observe media deadlines.• Escort media representatives to
ensure safety.
• Keep records of information
released.
• Provide press releases when
possible.
Don’ts
• Do not speculate about the
incident.
• Do not permit unauthorized
personnel to release informa-tion.
• Do not cover up facts or mis-
lead the media.
• Do not place blame for the
incident.Press releases about facility-gener-
ated emergencies should describewho is involved in the incidentand what happened, includingwhen, where, why and how.
FUNCTION
Planning
Considerations
Consider making contractual
arrangements with vendors forsuch post-emergency services asrecords preservation, equipmentrepair, earthmoving or engineering.
Meet with your insurance carri-
ers to discuss your property andbusiness resumptions policies (seethe next page for guidelines).
Determine critical operations
and make plans for bringing thosesystems back on-line. The processmay entail:
• Repairing or replacing
equipment
• Relocating operations to an
alternate location
• Contracting operations on a
temporary basis
Take photographs or videotape
the facility to document companyassets. Update these records regularly.Continuity of
Management
You can assume that not every
key person will be readily avail-able or physically at the facilityafter an emergency. Ensure thatrecovery decisions can be madewithout undue delay.

Consultyour legal department regardinglaws and corporate bylaws govern-ing continuity of management.
Establish procedures for:
• Assuring the chain of
command
• Maintaining lines of succession
for key personnel
• Moving to alternate
headquarters
Include these considerations in
all exercise scenarios.RECOVERY AND RESTORATION.
Business recovery and restoration,
or business resumption, goes right to a facility’s bottom line:  keeping peopleemployed and the business running.RECOVERY
ANDRESTORATION
PAGE 43
PAGE 44Insurance
Most companies discover that
they are not properly insured onlyafter they have suffered a loss.Lack of appropriate insurance canbe financially devastating.Discuss the following topics withyour insurance advisor to deter-mine your individual needs.
• How will my property be
valued?
• Does my policy cover the cost
of required upgrades to code?
• How much insurance am I
required to carry to avoidbecoming a co-insurer?
• What perils or causes of loss
does my policy cover?
• What are my deductibles?• What does my policy require
me to do in the event of a loss?
• What types of records and
documentation will my insur-ance company want to see?Are records in a safe placewhere they can be obtainedafter an emergency?
• To what extent am I covered
for loss due to interruption ofpower? Is coverage provided for both on- and off-premisespower interruption?• Am I covered for lost income
in the event of business inter-ruption because of a loss? Do Ihave enough coverage?

Forhow long is coverage provided?How long is my coverage forlost income if my business isclosed by order of a civilauthority?
• To what extent am I covered
for reduced income due to cus-tomers’ not all immediatelycoming back once the businessreopens?
• How will my emergency man-
agement program affect myrates?
Employee Support
Since employees who will rely
on you for support after an emer-gency are your most valuableasset, consider the range of ser-vices that you could provide orarrange for, including:
uCash advances
uSalary continuation
uFlexible work hours
uReduced work hours
uCrisis counseling
uCare packages
uDay careAfter a site emergency, assess the
impact of the event on businessneighbors and the communityand take appropriate action.How you handle this issue willhave long-lasting consequences.
PAGE 45Resuming Operations
Immediately after an emergency,
take steps to resume operations.
• Establish a recovery team, if
necessary. Establish prioritiesfor resuming operations.
• Continue to ensure the safety
of personnel on the property.Assess remaining hazards.Maintain security at the incident scene.
• Conduct an employee briefing.• Keep detailed records. Consider
audio recording all decisions.Take photographs of or video-tape the damage.
• Account for all damage-related
costs. Establish special joborder numbers and chargecodes for purchases and repairwork.
• Follow notification procedures.
Notify employees’ familiesabout the status of personnelon the property. Notify off-duty personnel about work sta-tus. Notify insurance carriersand appropriate government agencies.
• Protect undamaged property.
Close up building openings.Remove smoke, water anddebris. Protect equipmentagainst moisture. Restoresprinkler systems. Physicallysecure the property. Restorepower.
• Conduct an investigation.
Coordinate actions with appro-priate government agencies.• Conduct salvage operations.
Segregate damaged fromundamaged property. Keepdamaged goods on hand untilan insurance adjuster has visited the premises, but youcan move material outside if it’s seriously in the way andexposure to the elements won’tmake matters worse.
• Take an inventory of damaged
goods.

This is usually donewith the adjuster, or theadjuster’s salvor if there is anyappreciable amount of goods or value. If you release goods to the salvor, obtain a signedinventory stating the quantityand type of goods beingremoved.
• Restore equipment and proper-
ty. For major repair work,review restoration plans withthe insurance adjuster andappropriate government agencies.
• Assess the value of damaged
property. Assess the impact ofbusiness interruption.
• Maintain contact with cus-
tomers and suppliers.

HAZARDS
Planning
Considerations
Consider the following when
developing your plan:
• Meet with the fire department
to talk about the community’sfire response capabilities. Talkabout your operations. Identifyprocesses and materials thatcould cause or fuel a fire, orcontaminate the environmentin a fire.
• Have your facility inspected for
fire hazards. Ask about firecodes and regulations.
• Ask your insurance carrier to
recommend fire prevention andprotection measures. Your car-rier may also offer training.
• Distribute fire safety informa-
tion to employees:  how to pre-vent fires in the workplace,how to contain a fire, how toevacuate the facility, where toreport a fire.
• Instruct personnel to use the
stairs — not elevators — in afire. Instruct them to crawl ontheir hands and knees whenescaping a hot or smoke-filledarea. • Conduct evacuation drills.
Post maps of evacuation routesin prominent places. Keepevacuation routes includingstairways and doorways clear ofdebris.
• Assign fire wardens for each
area to monitor shutdown andevacuation procedures.
• Establish procedures for the
safe handling and storage offlammable liquids and gases.Establish procedures to preventthe accumulation of com-bustible materials.
• Provide for the safe disposal of
smoking materials.
• Establish a preventive mainte-
nance schedule to keep equip-ment operating safely.
• Place fire extinguishers in
appropriate locations.
• Train employees in use of fire
extinguishers.
PAGE 51FIRE. Fire is the most common of all the hazards. Every year fires cause
thousands of deaths and injuries and billions of dollars in property damage.FIRE
PAGE 52• Install smoke detectors.

Check
smoke detectors once a month,change batteries at least once ayear.
• Establish a system for warning
personnel of a fire. Considerinstalling a fire alarm withautomatic notification to thefire department.
• Consider installing a sprinkler
system, fire hoses and fire-resis-tant walls and doors.
• Ensure that key personnel are
familiar with all fire safety systems.
• Identify and mark all utility
shutoffs so that electricalpower, gas or water can be shutoff quickly by fire wardens orresponding personnel.
• Determine the level of response
your facility will take if a fireoccurs. Among the optionsare:
Option 1 — Immediate evacu-
ation of all personnel on alarm.Option 2 — All personnel are
trained in fire extinguisher use.Personnel in the immediatearea of a fire attempt to controlit. If they cannot, the firealarm is sounded and all per-sonnel evacuate.
Option 3 — Only designated
personnel are trained in fireextinguisher use.
Option 4 — A fire team is
trained to fight incipient-stagefires that can be controlledwithout protective equipmentor breathing apparatus. Beyondthis level fire, the team evacu-ates.
Option 5 — A fire team is
trained and equipped to fightstructural fires using protectiveequipment and breathing appa-ratus.
A hazardous material spill or
release can pose a risk to life,health or property. An incidentcan result in the evacuation of afew people, a section of a facilityor an entire neighborhood.
There are a number of Federal
laws that regulate hazardous mate-rials, including:  the SuperfundAmendments and ReauthorizationAct of 1986 (SARA), theResource Conservation andRecovery Act of 1976 (RCRA),the Hazardous MaterialsTransportation Act (HMTA), theOccupational Safety and HealthAct (OSHA), the ToxicSubstances Control Act (TSCA)and the Clean Air Act.
Title III of SARA regulates the
packaging, labeling, handling,storage and transportation of haz-ardous materials.

The law requiresfacilities to furnish informationabout the quantities and health
effects of materials used at thefacility, and to promptly notifylocal and State officials whenevera significant release of hazardousmaterials occurs.
In addition to on-site hazards,
you should be aware of the poten-tial for an off-site incident affect-ing your operations. You shouldalso be aware of hazardous materi-als used in facility processes and inthe construction of the physicalplant.
Detailed definitions as well as
lists of hazardous materials can beobtained from the EnvironmentalProtection Agency (EPA) and theOccupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA).HAZARDOUS MATERIALS INCIDENTS. Hazardous
materials are substances that are either flammable or combustible, explosive,toxic, noxious, corrosive, oxidizable, an irritant or radioactive.HAZARDOUS
MATERIALSINCIDENTS
PAGE 53HAZARDS
Planning
Considerations
Consider the following when
developing your plan:
• Identify and label all hazardous
materials stored, handled, pro-duced and disposed of by yourfacility. Follow governmentregulations that apply to yourfacility. Obtain material safetydata sheets (MSDS) for all haz-ardous materials at your location.
• Ask the local fire department
for assistance in developingappropriate response proce-dures.
• Train employees to recognize
and report hazardous materialspills and releases. Trainemployees in proper handlingand storage.
• Establish a hazardous material
response plan:
uEstablish procedures to notify
management and emergencyresponse organizations of an incident.
uEstablish procedures to warnemployees of an incident.
uEstablish evacuation procedures.
uDepending on your opera-tions, organize and train anemergency response team toconfine and control hazardousmaterial spills in accordancewith applicable regulations.• Identify other facilities in your
area that use hazardous materi-als. Determine whether an incident could affect your facility.
• Identify highways, railroads and
waterways near your facilityused for the transportation ofhazardous materials. Determinehow a transportation accidentnear your facility could affectyour operations.
PAGE 54
Most floods develop slowly over
a period of days. Flash floods,however, are like walls of waterthat develop in a matter of min-utes.

Flash floods can be causedby intense storms or dam failure.
Planning
Considerations
Consider the following when
preparing for floods:
• Ask your local emergency man-
agement office whether yourfacility is located in a floodplain. Learn the history offlooding in your area. Learnthe elevation of your facility inrelation to steams, rivers anddams.
• Review the community’s emer-
gency plan. Learn the commu-nity’s evacuation routes. Knowwhere to find higher ground incase of a flood.
• Establish warning and evacua-
tion procedures for the facility.Make plans for assistingemployees who may need trans-portation.• Inspect areas in your facility
subject to flooding. Identifyrecords and equipment that canbe moved to a higher location.Make plans to move recordsand equipment in case of flood.
• Purchase a NOAA Weather
Radio with a warning alarmtone and battery backup.Listen for flood watches andwarnings.
Flood Watch — Flooding is possible.
Stay tuned to NOAA radio. Be pre-
pared to evacuate. Tune to local radio
and television stations for additional
information.
Flood Warning — Flooding is
already occurring or will occur soon.
Take precautions at once. Be pre-
pared to go to higher ground. If
advised, evacuate immediately.
• Ask your insurance carrier for
information about flood insur-ance. Regular property andcasualty insurance does notcover flooding.FLOODS
AND FLASHFLOODS
PAGE 55HAZARDSFLOODS AND FLASH FLOODS. Floods are the most common
and widespread of all natural disasters. Most communities in the UnitedStates can experience some degree of flooding after spring rains, heavy thun-derstorms or winter snow thaws.
PAGE 56• Consider the feasibility of
floodproofing your facility.There are three basic types ofmethods.
1. Permanent floodproofing mea-
sures are taken before a flood
occurs and require no humanintervention when flood watersrise.

They include:
uFilling windows, doors or
other openings with water-resistant materials such asconcrete blocks or bricks.This approach assumes thestructure is strong enough towithstand flood waters.
uInstalling check valves to prevent water from enteringwhere utility and sewer linesenter the facility.
uReinforcing walls to resist water pressure. Sealing wallsto prevent or reduce seepage.
uBuilding watertight walls around equipment or workareas within the facility thatare particularly susceptible toflood damage.
uConstructing floodwalls orlevees outside the facility tokeep flood waters away.
uElevating the facility on walls,columns or compacted fill.This approach is most applica-ble to new construction,though many types of build-ings can be elevated.2. Contingent floodproofing
measures are also taken before
a flood but require some addi-tional action when floodingoccurs. These measuresinclude:
uInstalling watertight barriers
called flood shields to preventthe passage of water through doors, windows, ventilationshafts or other openings
uInstalling permanent water-tight doors
uConstructing movable flood-walls
uInstalling permanent pumpsto remove flood waters
3. Emergency floodproofing mea-
sures are generally less expen-
sive than those listed above,though they require substantialadvance warning and do notsatisfy the minimum require-ments for watertight flood-proofing as set forth by theNational Flood InsuranceProgram (NFIP). Theyinclude:
uBuilding walls with sandbags
uConstructing a double row of
walls with boards and posts tocreate a “crib,” then filling thecrib with soil
uConstructing a single wall bystacking small beams or plankson top of each other
• Consider the need for backup
systems:
uPortable pumps to remove
flood water
uAlternate power sources suchas generators or gasoline-pow-ered pumps
uBattery-powered emergencylighting
• Participate in community flood
control projects.
Hurricanes bring torrential
rains and a storm surge of oceanwater that crashes into land as thestorm approaches. Hurricanesalso spawn tornadoes.
Hurricane advisories are issued
by the National Weather Serviceas soon as a hurricane appears tobe a threat.

The hurricane seasonlasts from June through November.
Planning
Considerations
The following are considera-
tions when preparing for hurri-canes:
• Ask your local emergency man-
agement office about communi-ty evacuation plans.
• Establish facility shutdown pro-
cedures. Establish warning andevacuation procedures. Makeplans for assisting employeeswho may need transportation.
• Make plans for communicating
with employees’ families beforeand after a hurricane.
• Purchase a NOAA Weather
Radio with a warning alarmtone and battery backup.Listen for hurricane watchesand warnings.Hurricane Watch — A hurricane is
possible within 24 to 36 hours. Stay
tuned for additional advisories. Tune
to local radio and television stations
for additional information. An evacua-
tion may be necessary.
Hurricane Warning — A hurricane
will hit land within 24 hours. Take
precautions at once. If advised, evac-
uate immediately.
• Survey your facility. Make
plans to protect outside equip-ment and structures.
• Make plans to protect windows.
Permanent storm shutters offerthe best protection. Coveringwindows with 5/8” marine ply-wood is a second option.
• Consider the need for backup
systems:
uPortable pumps to remove
flood water
uAlternate power sources suchas generators or gasoline-pow-ered pumps
uBattery-powered emergencylighting
• Prepare to move records, com-
puters and other items withinyour facility or to another location.HURRICANES. Hurricanes are severe tropical storms with sustained
winds of 74 miles per hour or greater. Hurricane winds can reach 160 miles perhour and extend inland for hundreds of miles. HURRICANES
PAGE 57HAZARDS
Spawned from powerful thun-
derstorms, tornadoes can uproottrees and buildings and turn harm-less objects into deadly missiles ina matter of seconds. Damagepaths can be in excess of one milewide and 50 miles long.
Tornadoes can occur in any
state but occur more frequently inthe Midwest, Southeast andSouthwest.

They occur with littleor no warning.
Planning
Considerations
The following are considera-
tions when planning for torna-does:
• Ask your local emergency man-
agement office about the com-munity’s tornado warning system.
• Purchase a NOAA Weather
Radio with a warning alarmtone and battery backup.Listen for tornado watches andwarnings.Tornado Watch — Tornadoes are
likely. Be ready to take shelter. Stay
tuned to radio and television stations
for additional information.
Tornado Warning — A tornado has
been sighted in the area or is indicat-
ed by radar. Take shelter immediately.
• Establish procedures to inform
personnel when tornado warn-ings are posted. Consider theneed for spotters to be responsi-ble for looking out forapproaching storms.
• Work with a structural engineer
or architect to designate shelterareas in your facility. Ask yourlocal emergency managementoffice or National WeatherService office for guidance.
• Consider the amount of space
you will need. Adults requireabout six square feet of space;nursing home and hospitalpatients require more.
• The best protection in a torna-
do is usually an undergroundarea. If an underground area isnot available, consider:TORNADOES. Tornadoes are incredibly violent local storms that
extend to the ground with whirling winds that can reach 300 mph. TORNADOES
PAGE 59HAZARDS

uProtected areas away fromdoors and windows
Note: Auditoriums, cafeterias
and gymnasiums that are coveredwith a flat, wide-span roof are notconsidered safe.
• Make plans for evacuating per-
sonnel away from lightweightmodular offices or mobilehome-size buildings.

Thesestructures offer no protectionfrom tornadoes.
• Conduct tornado drills.• Once in the shelter, personnel
should protect their heads withtheir arms and crouch down.
Planning
Considerations
Following are considerations
for preparing for winter storms:
• Listen to NOAA Weather
Radio and local radio and tele-vision stations for weatherinformation:
Winter Storm Watch — Severe win-
ter weather is possible.
Winter Storm Warning — Severe
winter weather is expected.
Blizzard Warning — Severe winter
weather with sustained winds of at
least 35 mph is expected.
Traveler’s Advisory — Severe win-
ter conditions may make driving diffi-
cult or dangerous.• Establish procedures for facility
shutdown and early release ofemployees.
• Store food, water, blankets, bat-
tery-powered radios with extrabatteries and other emergencysupplies for employees whobecome stranded at the facility.
• Provide a backup power source
for critical operations.
• Arrange for snow and ice
removal from parking lots,walkways, loading docks, etc.SEVERE WINTER
STORMS
PAGE 61HAZARDSSEVERE WINTER STORMS. Severe winter storms bring heavy
snow, ice, strong winds and freezing rain. Winter storms can prevent employ-ees and customers from reaching the facility, leading to a temporary shutdownuntil roads are cleared. Heavy snow and ice can also cause structural damageand power outages.
Earthquakes can seriously dam-
age buildings and their contents;disrupt gas, electric and telephoneservices; and trigger landslides,avalanches, flash floods, fires andhuge ocean waves called tsunamis.Aftershocks can occur for weeksfollowing an earthquake.
In many buildings, the greatest
danger to people in an earthquakeis when equipment and non-struc-tural elements such as ceilings,partitions, windows and lightingfixtures shake loose.
Planning
Considerations
Following are guidelines for
preparing for earthquakes:
• Assess your facility’s vulnerabil-
ity to earthquakes. Ask localgovernment agencies for seis-mic information for your area.
• Have your facility inspected by
a structural engineer. Developand prioritize strengtheningmeasures.

These may include:
uAdding steel bracing to frames
uAdding sheer walls to frames
uStrengthening columns and
building foundations
uReplacing unreinforced brickfiller walls• Follow safety codes when con-
structing a facility or makingmajor renovations.
• Inspect non-structural systems
such as air conditioning, com-munications and pollution con-trol systems. Assess the poten-tial for damage. Prioritize mea-sures to prevent damages.
• Inspect your facility for any
item that could fall, spill, breakor move during an earthquake.Take steps to reduce these hazards:
uMove large and heavy objects
to lower shelves or the floor.Hang heavy items away fromwhere people work.
uSecure shelves, filing cabinets,tall furniture, desktop equip-ment, computers, printers,copiers and light fixtures.
uSecure fixed equipment andheavy machinery to the floor.Larger equipment can beplaced on casters and attachedto tethers which attach to thewall.
uAdd bracing to suspendedceilings, if necessary.
uInstall safety glass whereappropriate.
uSecure large utility andprocess piping. EARTHQUAKES. Earthquakes occur most frequently west of the
Rocky Mountains, although historically the most violent earthquakes haveoccurred in the central United States. Earthquakes occur suddenly and withoutwarning.EARTHQUAKES
PAGE 63HAZARDS
• Keep copies of design drawings
of the facility to be used inassessing the facility’s safetyafter an earthquake.
• Review processes for handling
and storing hazardous materials.Have incompatible chemicalsstored separately.
• Ask your insurance carrier
about earthquake insuranceand mitigation techniques.
• Establish procedures to deter-
mine whether an evacuation isnecessary after an earthquake.
• Designate areas in the facility
away from exterior walls andwindows where occupantsshould gather after an earth-quake if an evacuation is notnecessary.• Conduct earthquake drills.
Provide personnel with the fol-lowing safety information:
uIn an earthquake, if indoors,
stay there. Take cover under asturdy piece of furniture orcounter, or brace yourselfagainst an inside wall. Protectyour head and neck.
uIf outdoors, move into theopen, away from buildings,street lights and utility wires.
uAfter an earthquake, stayaway from windows, skylightsand items that could fall.

Donot use the elevators.
uUse stairways to leave thebuilding if it is determinedthat a building evacuation isnecessary.
