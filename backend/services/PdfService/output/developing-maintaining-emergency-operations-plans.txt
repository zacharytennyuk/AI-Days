November 2010 Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101
Version 2.0  Developing and Maintaining
Emergency Operations Plans
 I am pleased to announce the release of Version 2.0 of Comprehensive Prepa redness Guide 101:
Developing and Maintaining Emergency Operations Plans .
 Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101 provid es guidance for developing emergency operations
plans. It promotes a common understanding of the fundamentals of risk-informed planning and decision making to help planners examine a hazard or threat and produce integrated, coordinated, and synchronized plans. The goal of CPG 101 is to assi st in making the planning process routine across all
phases of emergency management and for all homeland security mission areas. This Guide helps planners at all levels of government in their efforts to develop and maintain viable, all-hazards, all-threats
emergency plans.
 Based on input from state, territorial, tribal, and local  officials from across the United States, this update
of CPG 101 expands on the fundamentals contained in  the first version. With this edition, greater
emphasis is placed on representing and engaging the whole community—to include those with access and
functional needs, children, and those with household pets and service animals. Residents and all sectors of the community have a critical role and shared responsibility to take
appropriate actions to protect themselves, their families and organizations, and their properties. Planning that engages and includes the whole community serves as the focal point for building a collaborative and resilient community.
CPG 101 is the foundation for state, territorial, tribal, and local emergency planning in the United States. Planners in other disciplines, orga nizations, and the private sector, as well as other levels of government,
may find this Guide useful in the development of  their emergency operations plans. While CPG 101
maintains its link to previous guidance, it also re flects the reality of the current operational planning
environment. This Guide integrates key concepts from national preparedness policies and doctrines, as
well as lessons learned from disasters, major incidents, national assessments, and grant programs.

Preface
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101 prov ides Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) guidance on the fundamentals of planning a nd developing emergency operations plans (EOP).
CPG 101 shows that EOPs are connected to planning efforts in the areas of prevention, protection,
response, recovery, and mitigation. Version 2.0 of this Guide expands on these fundamentals and
encourages emergency and homeland security managers  to engage the whole community in addressing all
risks that might impact their jurisdictions.
 While CPG 101 maintains its link to previous guidance, it also reflects the reality of the current
operational planning enviro nment. This Guide integrates key concepts from national preparedness
policies and doctrines, as well as lessons learned fro m disasters, major incidents, national assessments,
and grant programs. CPG 101 provides methods for planners to:
• Conduct community-based planning that engages th e whole community by using a planning process
that represents the actual population in the comm unity and involves community leaders and the
private sector in the planning process
• Ensure plans are developed through an analysis of risk
• Identify operational assumptions and resource demands
• Prioritize plans and planning efforts to support their seamless transition from development to
execution for any threat or hazard
• Integrate and synchronize efforts across all levels of government.
 CPG 101 incorporates the following concepts from operational planning research and day-to-day experience:
• The process of planning is just as important as the resulting document.
• Plans are not scripts followed to the letter, but ar e flexible and adaptable to the actual situation.
• Effective plans convey the goals and objectives of the intended operation and the actions needed to
achieve them.
Successful operations occur when organizations know thei r roles, understand how they fit into the overall
plan, and are able to execute the plan. This Guide is part of a series of CPGs publishe d by FEMA. CPG 101 discusses the steps used to produce
an EOP, possible plan structures, and components of a basic plan and its annexes.

CPGs provide detailed
information about planning considerations fo r specific functions, hazards, and threats.
 CPG 101 is the foundation for state, territorial, tribal, and local emergency planning in the United States. Planners in other disciplines, orga nizations, and the private sector, as well as other levels of government,
may find this Guide useful in the development of their EOPs.

Introduction and Overview
Purpose
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101 provid es guidelines on developi ng emergency operations
plans (EOP). It promotes a common understanding of the fundamentals of risk-informed planning and
decision making to help planners examine a hazard or threat and produce integrated, coordinated, and synchronized plans. The goal of CPG 101 is to make the planning process routine across all phases of emergency management and for all homeland security mission areas. This Guide helps planners at all
levels of government in their efforts to develop and maintain viable all-hazards, all-threats EOPs.
Accomplished properly, planning provides a methodical way to engage the whole community in thinking
through the life cycle of a potential crisis, determ ining required capabilities, and establishing a framework
for roles and responsibilities. It shapes how a community envisions and shares a desired outcome, selects
effective ways to achieve it, and communicates expect ed results. Each jurisdic tion’s plans must reflect
what that community will do to address its specific ri sks with the unique resources it has or can obtain.
 Planners achieve unity of purpose through coordination and integration of plans across all levels of government, nongovernmental
organizations, the private sector, and individuals
and families. This supports the fundamental principle that, in many situations, emergency manage ment and homeland security operations start at the
local level and expand to include Federal, state, terri torial, tribal, regional, and private sector assets as the
affected jurisdiction requires additional resources and capabilities. Plans must, therefore, integrate vertically to ensure a common operati onal focus. Similarly, horizontal in tegration ensures that individual
department and agency EOPs fit into the jurisdic tion’s plans, and that each department or agency
understands, accepts, and is prepared to execute identified mission assignments. Incorporating vertical and horizontal integration into a shared planning co mmunity ensures that the sequence and scope of an
operation are synchronized.

“Let our advance worrying become advanced thinking
and planning.”
Winston Churchill
A shared planning community increases the likelihoo d of integration and synchronization, makes
planning cycles more efficient and effective, and makes plan maintenance easier.
Applicability and Scope
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEM A) recommends that teams responsible for
developing EOPs use CPG 101 to guide their efforts. It provides a context for emergency planning in
light of other existing plans and describes a universal planning process. This Guide recognizes that many
jurisdictions across the country have already deve loped EOPs that address many emergency management
operations. Therefore, CPG 101 establishes no immediate requirements, but suggests that the next
iteration of all EOPs follow this guidance.
 Additionally, regulatory requirements may necessitate the use of additiona l guides for the development of
certain EOP annexes (e.g., the requirements for th e Radiological Emergency Preparedness Program).
CPG 101 has been designed to complement the use of those guides where required by law or regulation.

Supersession
CPG 101 replaces State and Local Guide 101, which is  rescinded. In addition, CPG 101 Version 2.0
supersedes CPG 101 Version 1.0, which is rescinded. CPG 101 Version 2.0 also supersedes the Interim
CPG 301, which is rescinded.
How to Use This Guide
CPG 101 is designed to help both novi ce and experienced planners navigate  the planning process. Used in
its entirety, this Guide provides information and in struction on the fundamentals of planning and their
application. Chapters 1 and 2 lay the foundation for planning efforts by providing information on the
basics of planning (Chapter 1) and the environment wi thin which planners function (Chapter 2). With an
understanding of these fundamentals, the Guide then tr ansitions from theory to practice by discussing the
different plan formats and functions (Chapter 3) a nd moving into an explanation of the planning process
(Chapter 4). A detailed checklist, building upon Chapte rs 3 and 4, is provided in Appendix C.

Because
Appendix C provides a set of detailed questions to consider throughout the planning process, users are
encouraged to copy or remove this checklist and em ploy it as they work through the planning process in
Chapter 4.
Suggested Training
To use this Guide to its fullest, users will benef it from training in emergency management and emergency
planning. Appendix D provides a suggested list of training courses to increase users’ understanding of
emergency management and em ergency planning concepts.
National Incident Management System
Implementation
In November 2005, FEMA’s National Integration Center published guides for integrating National
Incident Management System (NIMS) concepts into EOPs.1 CPG 101 incorporates the concepts and
suggestions found in those documents , which have been discontinued.
Administrative Information
Terms and acronyms in the text come from the FEMA Acronyms, Abbreviations, and Terms; the National
Response Framework (NRF); the NIMS; or the Homela nd Security Act of 2002.

Websites referenced in
this Guide were active at the time of its publication.
 CPG 101 uses the following contextual definitions fo r incident, state, and local government throughout
the document:
• Incident  means an occurrence or event—natural, te chnological, or human-caused—that requires a
response to protect life, property, or the environm ent (e.g., major disasters, emergencies, terrorist
attacks, terrorist threats, civil unrest, wild land and urban fires, floods, hazardous materials
[HAZMAT] spills, nuclear accidents, aircraft accidents, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical

storms, tsunamis, war-related disasters, public health and medical emergencies, other occurrences
requiring an emergency response).
• State  means any state of the United States, and includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, Amer ican Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands, a Native American Tribe or organization,2 an Alaska native village or Regional
Native Corporation, and any possession of the United States.
• Local government  means:
– A county, municipality, city, town, township, local public authority, school district, special district, intrastate district, council of governments (regardless of whether the council of governments is incorporated as a not-for-profit corpor ation under state law), regional or interstate
government entity, or agency or instrumentality of a local government
– A rural community, unincorporated town or village, or other public entity.
Revision Process
FEMA will revise CPG 101, as needed, and issue cha nge pages through the publication distribution
system and online through approved sources. FEMA welcomes recommendations on how to improve th is Guide so it better serves the needs of the
emergency management community.

1. The Basics of Planning
Overview
The elected and appointed leaders in each jurisdic tion are responsible for ensuring that necessary and
appropriate actions are taken to protect people and pr operty from any threat or hazard. When threatened
by any hazard, citizens expect elected or appointed le aders to take immediate action to help them resolve
the problem. Citizens expect the government to marsha l its resources, channel the efforts of the whole
community—including voluntary organizations and the private sector—and, if necessary, solicit
assistance from outside the jurisdiction.
 Residents and all sectors of the community have a critical role and shared responsibility to take
appropriate actions to protect themselves, their families and organizations, and their properties. Planning that includes the whole community builds a resilient community.

 This chapter serves as a foundation for the rest of th e Guide by providing an overview of the basics of
planning. It describes how risk-informed, community -based planning supports decision making. This
chapter also discusses key planning concepts , effective planning, and planning pitfalls.
Planning Fundamentals
Planning Principles
Ap
 pplying the following principles to the planning proc ess is key to developing an all-hazards plan for
rotecting lives, property, and the environment:
Planning must be community-based,
representing the whole population and its needs. Understanding the composition of the
population—such as accounting for people with
disabilities, others with access and functional needs, and for the needs of children—must occur
from the outset of the planning effort. For example, the demographics of the population, includi ng its resources and needs, have a profound effect on
evacuation, shelter operations , and family reunification.
4 Another key consideration is the integration of
household pets and service animals into the planning  process.

Many individuals may make decisions on
whether to comply with protective action measure s based on the jurisdiction’s ability to address the
concerns about their household pets  and service animals. Establishing a profile of the community will also
let planners know if courses of action are feasible. For example, if the majority of the actual resident population do not own cars, then planning efforts must account for greater transportation resource requirements than if the population was predom inately composed of car-owning households. The
businesses that comprise your jurisdiction must also be a part of your demographics—your jurisdiction Community-based planning  is the concept that
planning must not only be re presentative of the actual
population within the community, but also must involve
the whole community in the planning process. The
process for engaging the whole community in
communit y-based planning  is discussed in Cha pter 4.
3 Per the Department of Homeland Security Risk Lexicon (http://www .dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/dhs_risk_lexicon.pdf), resiliency is the
ability for governments, infrastructures, systems, businesses, and citizenry to resist, absorb, recover from, or adapt to an ad verse
occurrence that may cause harm or destructi on to our health, safety, economic well-being,  essential services, or public confide nce.
4 Planners should ensure compliance with the r equirements of Title VI of the Civil Ri ghts Act of 1964, Executive Order 13166, th e
Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitati on Act, and other Federal, state, or local laws and anti-discri mination
laws.

may house the only business providing a critical re source to your area or the Nation. By fully
understanding the composition and requirements of the actual population (including all segments of the
community), community-based plans will lead to improved response and recovery activities and,
ultimately, overall preparedness.
Planning must include participation from all stakeholders in the community. Effective planning
ensures that the whole community is represented and involved in the planning process.

The most realistic
and complete plans are prepared by a diverse planning team, including representatives from the jurisdiction’s departments and agencies, civic leader s, businesses, and organizations (e.g., civic, social,
faith-based, humanitarian, educational, advocacy, pr ofessional) who are able to contribute critical
perspectives and/or have a role in executing the plan. The demographics of the community will aid in determining who to involve as the planning team is constructed. Including community leaders
representative of the entire community in planning reinforces the expectation that the community
members have a shared responsibility and strengthens the public motivation to conduct planning for
themselves, their families, and their organizations. For example, it is essential to incorporate individuals
with disabilities or specific access and functional needs a nd individuals with limited English proficiency,
as well as the groups and organizati ons that support these individuals, in all aspects of the planning
process. When the plan considers and incorporates the views of the individuals and organizations
assigned tasks within it, they are more  likely to accept and use the plan.
Planning uses a logical and analytical problem-so lving process to help address the complexity and
uncertainty inherent in potential hazards and threats. By following a set of logical steps that includes
gathering and analyzing information, determining ope rational objectives, and developing alternative ways
to achieve the objectives, planning allows a jurisdic tion or regional response structure to work through
complex situations. Planning helps a jurisdiction iden tify the resources at its disposal to perform critical
tasks and achieve desired outcomes/target levels of  performance. Rather than concentrating on every
detail of how to achieve the objective, an effectiv e plan structures thinking and supports insight,
creativity, and initiative in the face of an uncertain  and fluid environment. While using a prescribed
planning process cannot guarantee success, inadequa te plans and insufficient planning are proven
contributors to failure.
Planning considers all hazards and threats. While the causes of emergencies can vary greatly, many of
the effects do not. Planners can address common opera tional functions in their basic plans instead of
having unique plans for every type of hazard or threat .

For example, floods, wildfires, HAZMAT releases,
and radiological dispersal devices ma y lead a jurisdiction to issue an evacuation order and open shelters.
Even though each hazard’s characteristics (e.g., speed of onset, size of the affected area) are different, the
general tasks for conducting an evacua tion and shelter operations are the same. Planning for all threats and
hazards ensures that, when addressing emergency f unctions, planners identify common tasks and those
responsible for accomp lishing the tasks.
Planning should be flexible enough to add ress both traditional and catastrophic incidents. Scalable
planning solutions are the most likely to be understood and executed properly by the operational
personnel who have practice in applying them. Planners can test whether critical plan elements are sufficiently flexible by exercising them against scenarios of varying ty pe and magnitude. In some cases,
planners may determine that exceptional policies and approaches are necessary for responding to and recovering from catastrophic incidents. These excepti onal planning solutions should be documented
within plans, along with clear descriptions of the triggers that indicate they are necessary.
 Plans must clearly identify the mission and supporting goals (with desired results). More than any
other plan element, the clear definition of the mission and supporting goals (which specify desired
results/end-states) enables unity of effort and c onsistency of purpose am ong the multiple groups and
1-2

activities involved in executing the plan. Every othe r plan element should be designed and evaluated
according to its contributions to accomplishing the mission and achieving the goals and desired results.
Planning depicts the anticipated environment for action. This anticipation promotes early
understanding and agreement on planning assumptions and risks, as well as the context for interaction. In
situations where a specific hazard has not been  experienced, planning provides the opportunity to
anticipate conditions and systematically identify po tential problems and workable solutions. Planners
should review existing EOPs to ensure current assumptions are still necessary and valid. After-action
reports (AAR) of recent emergency operations and exer cises in the jurisdiction will help planners develop
a list of lessons learned to address when updating plans. Planning does not need to start from scratch .
Planners should take advantage of the experience of other planners, as well as plans generated by
other jurisdictions.

Further, many states publish
their own standards and guidance for emergency planning, conduct workshops and training courses, and assign their planners to work with local planners. FEMA offers resident, locally presented,
and independent study emergency planning courses. FEMA also publishes guidance related to planning
for specific functions and risks. By participating in this training and reviewing existing emergency or
contingency plans, planners can: Key infrastructure sectors, often owned and operated
by the private sector, are frequently well prepared to maintain their business continuity and protect their employees. Their planning often follows recognized
industry standards or established regulatory
requirements. Use key infrastructure planning to complement State and local planning.
• Identify applicable authorities and statutes
• Gain insight into community risk perceptions
• Identify organizational arrangements used in the past
• Identify mutual aid agreements (MAA) with other jurisdictions
• Identify private sector planning that can comp lement and focus public sector planning
• Learn how historical planning issues were resolved
• Identify preparedness gaps.
Planning identifies tasks, allocates resources to accomplish those tasks, and establishes
accountability. Decision makers must ensure that they provide planners with clearly established priorities
and adequate resources; additionally, planners and plan participants should be held accountable for
effective planning and execution.
Planning includes  senior officials throughout the pro cess to ensure both understanding and
approval. Potential planning team members have many da y-to-day concerns but must be reminded that
emergency planning is a high priority. Senior o fficial buy-in helps the planning process meet
requirements of time, planning horizons, simplicity, and level of detail.

The more involved decision
makers are in planning, the bette r the planning product will be.
 The emergency or homeland security planner, hereafter referred to simply as “planner,” must reaffirm the
senior official’s understanding that planning is an ite rative, dynamic process that ultimately facilitates his
or her job in a crisis situation by:
• Identifying and sharing the hazard, risk, and threat analyses for the jurisdiction
• Discussing readiness and cap ability assessments, as well as exercise critiques
  1-3
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
• Describing what the government body and the senior offi cial will have to do prior to, during, and after
an incident to either prevent or minimize the incident’s impact.
Senior officials play a critical role in determining when and which plans should be developed or revised.
Additionally, they customarily have the authority to  approve the final product in coordination with key
stakeholders. By participating th roughout the planning process, senio r officials will better understand how
to implement the plan during an incident. Time, uncertainty, risk, and experience influence planning . These factors define the starting point
where planners apply appropriate concepts and methods to create solutions to particular problems. Planning is, therefore, often considered to be both an art and a science in that successful planners are able
to draw from both operational experience and an unders tanding of emergency management principles, but
also are intuitive, creative, and have the ability to  anticipate the unexpected. While the science and
fundamental principles of planning can be learned th rough training and experience, the art of planning
requires an understanding of the dynamic relations hips among stakeholders, of special political
considerations, and of the complexity imposed by the situation. Because this activity involves judgment and the balancing of competing demands, plans s hould not be overly detailed—to be followed by the
letter—or so general that they provide insufficient direction. Mastering the balance of art and science is the most challenging aspect of becoming a successful planner. Effective plans tell those with operational responsib ilities what to do and why to do it, and they
instruct those outside the jurisdiction in how to provide support and what to expect. Plans must
clearly communicate to operational personnel and support providers what their roles and responsibilities are and how those complement the activities of others . There should be no ambiguity regarding who is
responsible for major tasks.

This enables personnel to operate as a productive team more effectively,
reducing duplication of effort and enha ncing the benefits of collaboration.
 Planning is fundamentally a process to manage risk . Risk
management is a process by which context is defined, risks are identified and assessed, and courses of action for managing those risks are analyzed, decided upon, and implemented,
monitored, and evaluated. As part of the process, planning is a
tool that allows for systematic risk management to reduce or eliminate risks in the future.
Planning is one of the key components of the preparedness
cycle. The preparedness cycle ( Figure 1.1 ) illustrates the way
that plans are continuously evaluated and improved through a
cycle of planning, organizing, training, equipping, exercising, evaluating, and taking corrective action.
Strategic, Operational, and Tactical Planning
There are three tiers of planning: strategic planning, operational planning, and tactical (incident scene) planning. Stra tegic planning sets the context and expectations for
operational planning, while operationa l planning provides the framework for tactical planning. All three
tiers of planning occur at all levels of government. Figure 1.1: The Preparedness Cycle
 Strategic plans  describe how a jurisdiction wants to meet its emergency management or homeland
security responsibilities over the long-term. These plans are driven by policy from senior officials and
establish planning priorities.
1-4
1. The Basics of Planning
Operational plans  provide a description of roles and responsibilities, tasks, integration, and actions
required of a jurisdiction or its departments and agen cies during emergencies. Jurisdictions use plans to
provide the goals, roles, and responsibilities that a jurisdiction’s departments and agencies are assigned,
and to focus on coordinating and integrating the activ ities of the many response and support organizations
within a jurisdiction. They also consider private sector  planning efforts as an integral part of community-
based planning, and to ensure efficient allocation of resources. Department and agency plans do the same
thing for the internal elements of those organizations . Operational plans tend to focus more on the broader
physical, spatial, and time-related dimensions of an operation; thus, they tend to be more complex and
comprehensive, yet less defined, than tactical plans. Tactical plans  focus on managing personnel, equipment, and resources that play a direct role in an
incident response.

Pre-incident tactical planning , based upon existing operational plans, provides the
opportunity to pre-identify personnel, equipment, ex ercise, and training requirements. These gaps can
then be filled through various means (e.g., mutu al aid, technical assistance, updates to policy,
procurement, contingency leasing).
Figure 1.2: Relationship Between Strate gic, Operational, and Tactical Planning
Comprehensive and integrated planning can help othe r levels of government plan their response to an
incident within a jurisdiction. By knowing the exte nt of the jurisdiction’s capability, supporting planners
can pre-identify shortfalls and deve lop pre-scripted resource requests.
Planning Approaches
Planners use a number of approaches, either singly or in combination, to develop plans:
• Scenario-based planning. This approach starts with building a scenario for a hazard or threat. Then,
planners analyze the impact of the scenario to determine appropriate courses of action. Planners
  1-5
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
typically use this planning concept to develop pl anning assumptions, primarily for hazard- or threat-
specific annexes to a basic plan.
• Function-based planning (functional planning). This approach identifies the common functions that
a jurisdiction must perform during emergencies. F unction-based planning defines the function to be
performed and some combination of government  agencies and departments responsible for its
performance as a course of action.
• Capabilities-based planning . This approach focuses on a jurisdicti on’s capacity to take a course of
action. Capabilities-based planning answers the question, “Do I have the right mix of training,
organizations, plans, people, leadership and management, equipment, and facilities to perform a required emergency function?” Some planners view this approach as a combination of scenario- and
function-based planning because of its “scenario-to-task-to-capability” focus.
In reality, planners commonly use a combination of the three previous approaches to operational
planning. This hybrid planning approach provides the basis for the planning process discussed in
Chapter 4. Using the hybrid approach converts re quirements generated by a scenario into goals and
objectives that drive the planning process.

It leads to a basic plan that describes overarching roles,
relationships, and responsibilities with functional, hazard, and threat a nnexes that reflect sequencing of
actions. A hybrid planning approach helps identify the courses of action that a jurisdiction must be able to
take and the required functions it must perform based upon a comprehensive risk analysis; thus, it helps
identify the capabilities a jurisdiction must have. FEMA strongly advocates the hybrid approach.
Plan Integration
National guidance and consensus standards expect th at a jurisdiction’s plans will be coordinated and
integrated among all levels of governme nt and with critical infrastructure planning efforts. The NIMS and
NRF support a concept of layered operations. They recognize that all incidents start at the local level, and,
as needs exceed resources and capabilities, Federal, state,  territorial, tribal, regional, and private sector
assets are applied. This approach mean s that planning must be vertically integrated to ensure that all
response levels have a common operational focus. Sim ilarly, planners at each level must ensure that
department and supporting agency plans fit into th eir jurisdiction’s concept of operations (CONOPS)
through horizontal integration. Planners must  also appropriately integrate the community’s
nongovernmental and private sector plans and resources. Vertical integration  is the meshing of planning both up and dow n the various levels of government. It
follows the concept that the foundation for operations is at the local level and that support from Federal,
state, territorial, tribal, regional, and private sector  entities is layered onto the local activities. This means
that as a planning team identifies a support requirement from a “higher level” during the planning
process, the two levels work together to resolve the situation. Chapter 2 presents a concept for vertical integration.
Horizontal integration serves two purposes. First, it integrates operations across a jurisdiction. For
example, an agency, department, or sector would writ e its plan or standard ope rating procedures/standard
operating guidelines (SOPs/SOGs) for its role in an evacuation to fit the controlling jurisdiction’s plan for
such an evacuation. Horizontal integration allows departments and support agencies to produce plans that meet their internal needs or regulatory requirements and still integrate into the EOP.

Second, horizontal
integration ensures that a jurisdiction’s set of plan s supports its neighboring or partner jurisdictions’
similar sets of plans. A jurisdiction’s plan should include information about mission assignments that it executes in conjunction with, in support of, or with support from its neighbors or partners.

1. The Basics of Planning
Plan Synchronization
The concept of sequencing creates effective EOPs that  are synchronized in time, space, and purpose. Four
planning concepts help sequence operations: phasing, branches, planning horizons, and forward and
reverse planning.
Phasing . A phase is a specific part of an operation that is  distinctly different from the ones that precede or
follow. For example, a set of phases might incl ude routine operations, heightened awareness,
mobilization-activation-deployment, incident response, and transition to recovery. Planners often use the
factors of time, distance, geography, resources, and critical events to define phase lengths.
Branches. A branch is an option built into an EOP. For ex ample, a hurricane may affect a certain state by
moving up its coast, by moving inland and traveling up a large bay, or by taking a more middle track that
affects both areas. While many elements of the plan would be the same for all three scenarios, the change
in track could affect response activities. Under the c oncept of branching, the hurricane annex of an EOP
would provide options for each major contingency, th erefore allowing the planner to anticipate different
requirements and courses of action. Planners use br anches only for major, critical options and not for
every possible variation in the response. Planning horizon. A planning horizon is a point in time that planners use to focus the planning effort.
Because no one can predict when most incidents will occur, planners typically use planning horizons
expressed in months to years when developing EOPs . For example, the base components of an EOP may
be updated on a two- to three-year cycle, while ke y annexes may be on a shorter cycle. Since planners
develop these plans with little or no specific knowledge of how a future incident will evolve, the plan must describe broad concepts that allow for quick a nd flexible operations.

They must allow for several
courses of action and project potential uses of or ganizations and resources during those operations.
Planners should view plans as living contingency plans because they provide the starting point for
response operations if and when an emergency occurs.
 Forward and reverse planning. Forward planning starts with (assum ed) present conditions and lays out
potential decisions and actions forward in time, buildi ng an operation step-by-step toward the desired goal
or objective. Conversely, reverse planning starts w ith the end in mind and works backward, identifying
the objectives necessary and the related actions to ach ieve the desired end-state. When using reverse
planning, it is essential to have a well-defined goal or  objective. In practice, planners usually use a
combination of the two methods: they use forward planning  to look at what is feasible in the time allotted
and use reverse planning to establish the desire d goal (or end-state) and related objectives.
Common Planning Pitfalls
The most common planning pitfall is the developmen t of lengthy, overly detailed plans that those
responsible for their execution do not read. A plan that tries to cover every conceivable condition or that
attempts to address every detail will only frustrate, constrain, and confuse those charged with its
implementation. Successful plans are simple and flexible.
 Another major pitfall faced by planners is faili ng to account for the community’s needs, concerns,
capabilities, and desire to help. Often, plans are writte n based on the “average citizen” or mirror image of
the planners. However, communities are diverse and co mprise a wide variety of people, including those
with access and functional needs, those requiring the support of service animals, and those who cannot independently care for themselves, such as children. This also includes diverse racial and ethnic populations and immigrant communitie s. Failing to base planning on th e demographics and requirements
of the particular community may lead to false planning assumptions, ineffective courses of action, and
inaccurate resource calculations. Related to this pitfall is the notion that responders are the only people
  1-7
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
who can take action. The public often does their work  before responders arrive.

The community must be
engaged in the planning pr ocess and included as an integral part of the plan.
Planning is only as good as the information on which it is based. Too often, planners rely on untested
assumptions or uncoordinated resources. Planners shoul d ensure that they have adequately validated
assumptions and properly coordinate d with those agencies/entities that  they include in their plan.
Planning needs may be coordinated directly with a required agency/entity via a memorandum of
agreement (MOA)/memorandum of understanding (MOU) or by signatory of a designated representative.
Planning is not a theoretical process that occurs w ithout an understanding of the community, nor is it a
scripting process that tries to prescribe hazard actions and response actions with unjustified precision.
Community-based plans provide a starting point for op erations, adjusting as the situation dictates and as
facts replace planning assumptions.
Planning Considerations
Emergency planning includes the key areas involved in addressing any threat or hazard: prevention, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation. Integrating the key areas as part of the overall planning effort allows jurisdictions to produce an effective EOP and advance overall preparedness.
 Prevention  consists of actions that reduce risk from hum an-caused incidents, primarily terrorism (see
Figure 1.3 ). Prevention planning can also help mitigate secondary or opportunistic incidents that may
occur after the primary incident. Incorporating prevention methods into the comprehensive planning process also helps a jurisdiction identify information or intelligence requirements that support the overall
planning process.
Figure 1.3: Types of Hazards
Protection reduces or eliminates a threat to people, propert y, and the environment. Primarily focused on
adversarial incidents, the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources (CIKR) is vital to local jurisdictions, national security, pub lic health and safety, and econo mic vitality. Protection planning
safeguards citizens and their freedoms, critical infr astructure, property, and the economy from acts of
terrorism, natural disasters, or other emergencies. It includes actions or measures taken to cover or shield
1-8
1.

The Basics of Planning
assets from exposure, injury, or destruction.
Protective actions may occur before, during, or after an incident and prevent, minimize, or
contain the impact of an incident.
 Response embodies the actions taken in the immediate aftermath of an incident to save and sustain lives, meet basic human needs, and reduce the loss of property and the effect on
critical infrastructure and the environment.
Following an incident, response operations reduce the physical, psychological, social, and economic effects of an incident. Response planning provides rapid and disciplined incident
assessment to ensure a quickly scalable,
adaptable, and flexible response. It incorporates national response doctrine as presented in the NRF, which defines basic roles and responsibilities for incident response across all
levels of government and the private sector.
Recovery encompasses both short-term and long-term efforts for the rebuilding and revitalization of affected communities. Recovery planning builds stakeholder
partnerships that lead to community restoration
and future sustainability and resiliency.
5
Recovery planning must provide for a near-seamle ss transition from response activities to short-term
recovery operations—including restoration of interrupted utility services, reestablishment of
transportation routes, and the provision of food and shelter to displaced persons. Planners should design
long-term recovery plans to maximize results thr ough the efficient use of resources and incorporate
national recovery doctrine. A recovery plan should address: Planning for Adaptive versus Non-Adaptive Risks
One of the fundamental challenges planners face is how
to address, through their planning efforts, the differences
in risk that a hazard or threat poses to a jurisdiction. One way to focus those efforts is to determine whether the hazard’s or threat’s risk is adaptive or non-adaptive. A
hazard or threat shows adaptive risk if it has the ability to change its behavior or characteristics in reaction to protection, prevention, response, or recovery measures taken by a jurisdiction. Only human-caused hazards or
adversarial threats, such as civil disturbances or
terrorism, have adaptive risk characteristics. When facing a hazard or threat characterized by adaptive risk, planners must continually evaluate and evolve their plans
as the adversary learns and adapts to existing plans.
Natural and technological hazards fall into the category of non-adaptive risks. Their physical characteristics and
disaster dimensions do not change when a jurisdiction
takes preventive, protective, or mitigation measures.

Plans for such hazards tend to be more stable, requiring change only as the characteristics of the jurisdiction
change. Traditional mitigation activities are most
appropriate to deal with these risks. It is important to remember that this is not a “black and white” differentiation—extremist groups may take the opportunity
presented by a hurricane (non-adaptive risk) to launch a
terrorist attack (adaptive risk).
• Recovery-related MAAs and regional compacts
• Prewritten emergency ordinances that facilitate rec overy operations, such as those dealing with road
closures, debris removal,  and expedited permitting
• Continuity of government (COG) operations (may also be addressed in a separate continuity of
operations [COOP] plan)
• Strategies for including civic leaders and the public in the recovery decision-making process
• Community efforts that affect mitigation processes with  the potential to reduce the effects of a threat
or incident.
 Mitigation , with its focus on the impact of a hazard, encompasses the structural and non-structural
approaches taken to eliminate or limit a hazard’s presen ce; peoples’ exposure; or interactions with people,
property, and the environment. The emphasis on sustai ned actions to reduce long-term risk differentiates

Examples of mitigation
activities include:
• Complying with or exceeding National Flood Insura nce Program floodplain management regulations
• Enforcing stringent building codes, flood-proofing requirements, seismic design standards, and wind-
bracing requirements for new constructi on or repairing existing buildings
• Adopting zoning ordinances that steer development aw ay from areas subject to flooding, storm surge,
or coastal erosion
• Retrofitting public buildings to withstand ground shaking or hurricane-strength winds
• Acquiring damaged homes or businesses in flood-prone areas, relocating the structures, and returning
the property to open space, wetlands, or recreational uses
• Building community shelters and tornado safe rooms to help protect people in their homes, public
buildings, and schools in hurricane- and tornado-prone areas.
2. Understanding the
Planning Environment: Federal, State, and Local Plans
Overview
Understanding the basics of planning is critical to the planner’s role. Building on that understanding, this
chapter explains the environment within which this planning occurs, outlines the links between different
levels of government, and summarizes how planning  considerations shape the content of the NRF,
Federal plans, and state/local EOPs.
Relationship Between Federal Plans and State Emergency Operations Plans
Federal plans and state EOPs describe each respective government-level approach to emergency operations. Because these levels of government all pr ovide support to emergency operations conducted at
the local level, there are similar and overlapping functions in their plans.
 As indicated in Chapter 1, all levels of government mu st coordinate plans vertically to ensure a singular
operational focus. The goal is to ensure the eff ectiveness of combined Federal and state operations
through integration and synchroniza tion. Key concepts for a national planning structure—integration and
synchronization—serve different but equally important purposes in linking Federal plans and state EOPs.
 From the Federal perspective, integrated planning helps answer the question of how Federal agencies and
departments add the right resources at the right time to support state and local operations. From the states’
perspectives, integrated planning provides answers to  questions about which other organizations to work
with and where to obtain resources.
The National Incident Management System
NIMS provides a consistent framework for incident management, regardless of the cause, size, or
complexity of the incident.

NIMS provides the Nati on’s first responders and authorities with the same
foundation for incident management for all hazards. The Incident Command System (ICS) is a critical
component of NIMS and is used to manage all domestic incidents.
  2-1
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
As part of the development of EOPs, instituti onalizing NIMS means that government officials:
• Adopt NIMS through executive order, proclamation,  or legislation as the jurisdiction’s official
incident response system
• Direct all incident managers and response organizations in their jurisdictions to train, exercise, and
use NIMS in their response operations
• Integrate NIMS into functional, system-wide emer gency operations policies, plans, and procedures
• Provide ICS training for responders, su pervisors, and command-level officers
• Conduct exercises for responders at all levels , including responders from all disciplines and
jurisdictions.
Depending on the jurisdiction, institutionalization means that an EOP should:
• Use ICS and the multiagency coordination system to  manage and support all incidents, including
recurring and/or planned special events
• Integrate all response agencies and entities into a single, seamless system, from the incident command
post, to the department emergency operations centers  (EOC) and local EOCs, to the state EOC, and to
regional- and national-level entities
• Develop and implement a public information plan
• Identify and characterize all resources according to established standards and types
• Ensure that all personnel are trained properly for th e jobs they perform and the training is validated
• Ensure interoperability, accessibility, and redundancy of communications.
 Planners should consider each of these requirements as they develop or revise their jurisdiction’s EOP.
The National Response Framework
The NRF is a guide to how the Na tion conducts all-hazards incident response. The NRF states that each
Federal department or agency must also plan for its role in incident respon se. Virtually every Federal
department and agency possesses resources that a jurisdiction may need when responding to an incident. Some Federal departments and agen cies have primary responsibility for specific aspects of incident
response, such as HAZMAT remediation. Others may have supporting roles in providing different types
of resources, such as communications personnel and e quipment.

Regardless of their roles, all Federal
departments and agencies must develop policies, plans, and procedures governing how they will
effectively locate resources and provide them as part of a coordinated Federal response. The planning
considerations described for response can al so guide prevention and protection planning.
Planning Considerations
The NRF identifies government responsibility to devel op detailed all-hazards/all-threats EOPs. It states
these plans should:
• Define leadership roles and respons ibilities and clearly articulate the decisions that need to be made,
who will make them, and when
• Include an all-hazards basic plan, as well as hazard- and threat-specific annexes
• Integrate and incorporate key private sector and nongovernmental elements
2-2
2. Understanding the Planning Environment: Federal, State, and Local Plans
• Include strategies for both no-notice and forewarned evacuations, with particular consideration given
to assisting children, as well as individuals with disabilities, access and functional needs, or limited
English proficiency.
State, Territorial, and Tribal Government Planning
State, territorial, and tribal governments have significant resources of their own, including emergency
management and homeland security agencies, police departments, health agencies, transportation agencies, incident management teams, specialized teams, and the National Guard. The NRF states that the role of a state government during emergency response is to supplement local efforts before, during, and
after a disaster or emergency situation. If a state anticipates that its needs may exceed its resources, the
Governor can request assistance from other states through MAAs (e.g., Emergency Management Assistance Compact) and/or from the Federal Government.
Local Government Planning
Resilient Communities and Planning
Resilience, broadly defined, is the ability to
resist, absorb, recover from, or adapt to an
adverse occurrence. Engaging the community
in the planning process will improve community resiliency by increasing the understanding of threats and hazards,
participating in the planning process, and
communicating the expected actions for the community to undertake during an emergency.
At the local and state level, this entails
knowing the community and its demographics, as well as involving both the
formal and informal co mmunity leadership
structure in the planning process.

This is true
for all levels of government as each level works to engage the issues surrounding
individuals with access and functional needs,
individuals with limited English proficiency, children, and those with household pets and service animals.
Engaging the private sector is a critical
element of the process. Much of the critical
infrastructure necessary to our communities is
owned and operated by the private sector.
Connecting the government and the private
sector is, therefore, a necessary part of the
planning process. The NRF emphasizes the concept of resilient
communities. Resiliency begins with prepared individuals and depends on the leadership and engagement of local
government, civic leaders, and private sector businesses
and organizations. Local police, fire, emergency medical services (EMS), emergency management, public health and medical providers, public works, and other community agencies are often the first to be notified about a threat or
hazard or to respond to an incident. These entities should
work with individuals, families, and service providers for people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs to enhance their awareness of risk levels and specific threats, develop household emergency plans that include household pets and service animals, and
prepare emergency supply kits.
Concept of Operations
The NRF guides governments at all levels, the private
sector, nongovernmental organizations, and individual citizens toward a shared and effective response.

Upon
receiving the warning that a disaster is likely to occur or
has occurred, elements of the NRF may be implemented in a scalable and flexible way to improve response.
Functional Organization
The NRF uses 15 Emergency Support Functions (ESF) to
group and describe the kinds of resources and types of
Federal assistance available to augment state and local
response efforts:
  2-3
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
• ESF #1 Transportation • ESF #8 Public Health and Medical Services
• ESF #2 Communications • ESF #9 Search and Rescue
• ESF #3 Public Works and Engineering • ESF #10 Oil and Hazardous  Materials Response
• ESF #4 Firefighting • ESF #11 Agriculture and Natural Resources
• ESF #5 Emergency Management • ESF #12 Energy
• ESF #6 Mass Care, Emergency
Assistance, Housing, and
Human Services • ESF #13 Public Safety and Security
• ESF #14 Long-Term Community Recovery
• ESF #7 Logistics Management and
Resource Support • ESF #15 External Affairs.
Each ESF has a Federal department or agency identified as its coordinator. During response and recovery operations, the coordinating agency forms and activates a team that is responsible for working with the appropriate state and local officials to identify unmet resource needs. The team also coordinates the flow
of resources and assistance provided by the Federal Government to meet these needs.
Federal Emergency Plans at th e National and Regional Levels
The NRF serves as the foundation for the development of national and regional response plans that implement Federal response activities. At the national level, the Federal planning structure supports the
NRF. FEMA Regions are developing plans to address potentia l activities and actions taken by regional offices
of Federal departments and agencies in support of state and local operations. They also provide the
necessary link between the state EOP and the NRF.

Within an identified scope, each Regional plan
addresses one or more of the following:
• Specifies the responsibilities assigned to each of th e tasked Federal departments and agencies for
mobilizing and deploying resources to assist the state(s) in response/recovery efforts
• Describes the relationship between the responding Federal agencies/departments and their state
counterparts
• Provides information to the states on the various  response mechanisms, capabilities, and resources
available to them through the Federal Government
• Describes notification procedures and protocols for communicating with state officials; procedures
and systems for communication; frequency of contact; and message content
• Provides for Incident Management Assistance Team personnel to assist in conducting a rapid
situation assessment immediately prior to or after a disaster has occurred
• Describes coordination responsibilities of the regiona l liaison officer(s) and the provisions established
for deployment to the state EOC
• Provides for deployment of Incident Management Assistance Team members to the state EOC/Joint
Field Office (JFO) and/or staging locations or di rectly into the area impacted by the disaster
• Provides for obtaining work space in the state EOC and other locations for the initial response cadre;
arrangements to obtain work space for the JFO and ot her follow-on response teams; and a variety of
other activities that require extensive coordination.
2-4
2. Understanding the Planning Environment: Federal, State, and Local Plans
State, Territorial, and Tribal  Emergency Operations Plans
The state/territorial/tribal EOP addresses several operational response functions and describes how to
fulfill its mission of providing resources to satisfy un met needs. These functions focus on actions, such as
direction and control, warning, p ublic notification, and evacuation, that the state/territorial/tribal
government must take during the initial phase of respon se operations and that fall outside of the Federal
response mission. Thus, they are not appropriate for inclusion in Federal response plans.
 Because state/territorial/tribal governments must channel Federal assistance provided under the NRF,
some choose to mirror the NRF functions. There is no need to replicate the Fe deral ESFs exactly.

Some
have successfully used a hybrid approach, either by giving the counterparts of Federal ESFs extra
responsibilities appropriate to the state/territorial/tribal level or by creating functions in addition to those
used by the Federal Government to address state /territorial/tribal responsibilities and concerns. The
important thing is for the choice of functions to fit the state/territorial/tribal government’s own concept of
operations, policies, governmental structure, and r esource base. That fit is critical, because the EOP
describes what the state/territorial/tribal government  will do when conducting emergency operations. The
EOP:
• Identifies the departments and agencies designated to perform response and recovery activities and
specifies tasks they must accomplish
• Outlines the assistance that is available to local ju risdictions during disasters that generate emergency
response and recovery needs beyond what the local jurisdiction can satisfy
• Specifies the direction, control, and communications  procedures and systems that will be relied upon
to alert, notify, recall, and dispatch emergency response personnel; warn local jurisdictions; protect
residents and property; and request aid/support from other jurisdictions and/or the Federal
Government (including the role of the Governor’s Authorized Representative)
• Describes ways to obtain initial situation assessm ent information from the local jurisdiction(s)
directly affected by the disaster or emergency
• Describes how work space and communication suppo rt will be provided to the Regional Liaison
Officers and other Federal teams deployed to the EOC, staging areas, or the area directly impacted by
the disaster
• Designates a State Coordinating Officer to work directly with the Federal Coordinating Officer
• Assists the Federal Coordinating Officer in identif ying candidate locations for establishing the JFO
• Provides coordinating instructions and provisions for implementing interstate compacts, as applicable
• Describes the logistical support for planned operations.
Local Emergency Operations Plans
Local EOPs should largely be consistent with stat e/territorial/tribal plans. The EOP addresses several
operational response functions and describes how to fu lfill its mission of provi ding resources to satisfy
unmet needs.

These functions focus on actions, such as direction and control, warning, public notification, and evacuation, that the local government must take  during the initial phase of response operations and
that fall outside of the state/territorial/tribal response mission. Thus, they are not appropriate for inclusion in those response plans. Local jurisdictions should work w ith their state, territorial, or tribal leadership to
clearly delineate roles, responsibilities, and structures as required. At a minimum the EOP describes what the local government will do when conducting emergency operations. The EOP:
  2-5
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
2-6  • Identifies the departments and agencies designated to perform response and recovery activities and
specifies tasks they must accomplish
• Outlines the integration of assistance that is availabl e to local jurisdictions during disaster situations
that generate emergency response and recovery needs beyond what the local jurisdiction can satisfy
• Specifies the direction, control, and communications  procedures and systems that will be relied upon
to alert, notify, recall, and dispatch emergency response personnel; warn the public; protect residents
and property; and request aid/support from other jurisdictions and/or the Federal Government
(including the role of the Gove rnor’s Authorized Representative)
• Provides coordinating instructions and provi sions for implementing MAAs, as applicable
• Describes the logistical support for planned operations.
Linking Federal, State, and Local Emergency Plans
A close analysis of the planning relationships descr ibed in the previous section shows that the FEMA
Region is the interface between the Federal and ju risdictional planning processes. The FEMA Region is
the place where jurisdictional needs dur ing an incident are converted into Federal support missions until a
JFO is established. It is through the FEMA Region that  planning for Federal oper ations is integrated and
synchronized with planning for operations shaped by the hazards and risks faced by state, territorial,
tribal, and local communities.
 Course of action development determines jurisdictio nal needs during the planning process. Similarly,
FEMA Regions determine capability gaps, resource s hortfalls, and state expectations for Federal
assistance through the process of gap analysis. FEMA Regions conduct these analyses by using a joint
planning team with multiple state representatives, individually with each state, or through some other
method.

To ensure a common operational concept, each Region’ s plan may include an annex that summarizes the
CONOPS, priorities, concerns, and needs of each state within its jurisdiction.
 In short, the relationships established between the FEMA Region and all Federal, state, and local partners ensure effective collaboration before, during, and after emergency operations. The integrated plans
resulting from these relationships clarify the roles a nd responsibilities at all levels and result in more
effective operations.
3. Format and Function:
Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
Overview
The first two chapters provided a foundation for planners by illustrating not only the basics of planning,
but also the environment in which planning occurs. Chapter 3 shifts from theory to application by
examining the different types of plans and how they are used to meet the requirements of a jurisdiction.
The Emergency Operations Plan
Traditionally, the focus of a jurisdiction’s operational planning effort has been the EOP. EOPs are plans
that define the scope of preparedness and emergency management activities necessary for that jurisdiction. The EOP structures and concepts that follow provide an example for jurisdictions to use
when developing any plan. The EOP format works well for both conventional and complex emergency
operations. Emergency management involves several kinds of pl ans, just as it involves several kinds of actions.
While many jurisdictions consider the EOP the centerpi ece of their planning effort, it is not the only plan
that addresses emergency management  functions. Other types of plans that support and supplement the
EOP are discussed later in this chapter. A jurisdiction’s EOP is a document that:
• Assigns responsibility to organizations and individuals for carrying out specific actions that exceed
routine responsibility at projected times and places during an emergency
• Sets forth lines of authority and organizational relationships and shows how all actions will be
coordinated
• Describes how people (including unaccompanied minor s, individuals with disabilities, others with
access and functional needs, and individuals with limited English proficiency) and property are
protected
• Identifies personnel, equipment, facilities, supp lies, and other resources available within the
jurisdiction or by agreement with other jurisdictions
• Reconciles requirements with other jurisdictions.
An EOP is flexible enough for use in all emergencie s.

A complete EOP describes: the purpose of the plan;
the situation; assumptions; CONOPS; organization an d assignment of responsibilities; administration and
logistics; plan development and mainte nance; and authorities and references.
  3-1
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
The EOP contains annexes appropriate to the juri sdiction’s organization a nd operations. EOPs pre-
designate a jurisdictional lead agency and/or func tional area representatives to the incident command,
unified command, or multiagency coordination entity whenever possible to facilitate responsive and
collaborative incident management.
 The EOP facilitates prevention, protection, response, and short-term recovery, which sets the stage for
successful long-term recovery. Response actions and some post-disaster recovery issues, such as the
rebuilding and placement of temporary housing faciliti es, are time-sensitive. Advance planning makes
performing these tasks easier, especially in a changing environment. Jurisdictions, especially those with
known severe hazards and vulnerabilities, should in tegrate complex housing and overall recovery
planning with that of the EOP. Typically, an EOP does not detail long-term recovery  actions. However, the EOP should provide for a
transition to a long-term recovery plan, if any ex ists, and for a stand-down of response forces. As
mentioned previously, the EOP may cover some short-term  recovery actions that are natural extensions of
response. For example, meeting human needs requi res maintaining logistical support for mass care
actions initiated in the response phase. It could also involve the restoration of infrastructure “lifelines”
and the removal of debris to facilitate the response. At the state’s discretion, its disaster assistance plans for distribution of Federal and state relief funds might be included as an annex to the EOP. Disaster
assistance plans indicate how to identify, contact, match to aid, certify, and provide support to eligible aid
recipients.
State and Local Emergency Operations Plans
In the Nation’s system of emergency management, the local government must act first to address the
public’s emergency needs.

Depending on  the nature and size of the emergency, Federal, state, territorial,
tribal, and regional (e.g., the National Capital Re gion) assistance may be provided to the local
jurisdiction. The focus of local and tribal EOPs is on the emergency measures that are essential for
protecting the public. At the minimum, these measures include warning, emergency public information,
evacuation, and shelter.
 States, territories, and regional organizations play three roles: assisting local jurisdictions whose
capabilities must be augmented or are overwhelmed by an emergency; responding first to certain
emergencies; and working with the Federal Governme nt when Federal assistance is necessary. The state
EOP is the framework within which local EOPs are created and through which the Federal Government
becomes involved. As such, the state EOP ensures that all levels of government are able to mobilize in a
unified way to safeguard the well-being of their citi zens. The state and regional organization EOPs should
synchronize and integrate with local, tribal, and regional plans.
A planning team’s main concern is to include all essential information and instructions in the EOP.
FEMA does not mandate a particular format for EOPs. In the final analysis, an EOP’s format is
acceptable if users understand it, are comfortable with it, and can extract the information they need. In designing a format for an all-hazards EOP, the planning team should consider the following:
• Organization . Do the EOP section and subsection titles help u sers find what they need, or must users
sift through information that is not relevant? Can single plan components be revised without forcing a
substantial rewrite of the entire EOP?
• Progression. In any one section of the EOP, does each elem ent seem to follow from the previous one,
or are some items strikingly out of place? Can the reader grasp the rationale for the sequence and scan
for the information he or she needs?
3-2
3. Format and Function: Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
• Consistency. Does each section of the EOP use the same logical progression of elements, or must the
reader reorient himself or herself in each section?
• Adaptability.

Does the EOP’s organization make its inform ation easy to use during unanticipated
situations?
• Compatibility. Does the EOP format promote or hinder coordination with other jurisdictions,
including the state and/or Federal Government? Ca n reformatting the EOP or making a chart of the
coordinating relationships (i.e., a “cros swalk”) solve problems in this area?
• Inclusivity . Does the EOP appropriately address the needs of those with disabilities or other access
and functional needs, children, individuals with lim ited English proficiency,  and household pets and
service animals?
Structuring an Emergency Operations Plan
While the causes of emergencies vary greatly, their po tential effects do not. Jurisdictions can plan for
effects common to several hazards rather than de velop separate plans for each hazard. For example,
earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes can all force peopl e from their homes. The jurisdiction can develop a
plan organized around the task of finding shelter a nd food for individuals who have been displaced. If
desired, the EOP planners can make minor adjustme nts to reflect differences in the speed of onset,
duration, and intensity of the hazards.
 This section outlines a variety of formats that a jurisd iction could use when developing an EOP, including
a functional format, an ESF format, and an agency -/department-focused format. These format options
come from EOPs used by jurisdictions across the Nati on. They are suggestions for new planners on where
to begin when developing an EOP. Seasoned planners can use these fo rmats to validate the effectiveness
of their EOP’s organization. The planning team must try to identify all critical common tasks or functions that participating organizations must perform, and assign responsibility for accomplishing each task or function. The
planning team must work with the heads of tasked organizations to en sure that they prepare SOPs/SOGs
detailing how they will carry out critical tasks associated with the jurisdiction’s strategy.

Because the
jurisdiction’s goal is a coordinated and integrated re sponse, all EOP styles should flow from a basic plan
that outlines the jurisdiction’s overall emergency organization and its policies.
As the planning team begins to develop a new EOP,  members must discuss which format is the most
effective for and applicable to their jurisdiction. The jurisdiction’s style of government or the results of a
risk assessment may help the team decide which format to use. For example, in a sprawling metropolitan
county that contains several municipalities and has a complex government structure, county emergency
operations may assume more of a coordination and s upport role. Thus, an ESF approach may be optimal
for that county’s EOP. In contrast, a small rural community with a limited government structure and staff that performs multiple duties may benefit from a functi on-based EOP. In short, “form follows function”
in the sense that operational needs should help determ ine the EOP format a jurisdiction uses. Generally,
the functional or agency/department formats are used by local jurisdictions, while the ESF format tends to
be used by larger jurisdictions  and other levels of government.
None of these formats are mandatory to achieve NIMS  compliance. The planning team may modify any
of these formats to make the EOP fit the jurisd iction’s emergency management strategy, policy,
resources, and capabilities. Note, however, that some states prescribe an EOP format for their local
governments.

Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Traditional Functional Format
The traditional functional structure is probably the mo st commonly used EOP format. This is the format
that many jurisdictions have used to develop EOPs since the 1990s, following FEMA’s Civil
Preparedness Guide 1-8 and State and Local Guide 101,  which have been rescinded and replaced by this
Guide. The traditional functional format has three ma jor sections: the basic plan, functional annexes, and
hazard-specific annexes (see Figure 3.1 ).6
Figure 3.1: Traditional Functional EOP Format
6 The term annex  is used throughout this CPG to refer to functional, s upport, hazard/incident-specific, or  other supplements to the
basic plan, consistent with the NRF.

So me jurisdictions’ plans may use the term appendix  in the same fashion (e.g., hazard-specific
appendix).
3-4
3. Format and Function: Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
The basic plan provides an overview of the jurisd iction’s preparedness and response strategies. It
describes expected hazards, outlines agency roles and responsibilities, and explains how the jurisdiction
keeps the plan current.
The functional annexes are individual chapters that focus on missions (e.g., communications, damage assessment). These annexes describe th e actions, roles, and responsibilities of participating organizations.
Functional annexes discuss how the jurisdiction manages the function before, during, and after the emergency, and they identify the agencies that impl ement that function. However, each functional annex
addresses only general strategies used for any emergency.
The hazard-, threat-, or incident-specific annex es describe the policies, situation, CONOPS, and
responsibilities for particular hazards, threats, or incide nts. They explain the procedures that are unique to
that annex for a hazard type. For example, the dir ection and control annex may discuss how a local law
enforcement’s command post would coordinate its func tions; this information would only be addressed in
a hazard-, threat-, or incident-specific annex if it w ould be different for partic ular hazards, threats, or
incidents. Strategies already outlined in a functional annex should not be repeated in a hazard-specific annex. The traditional format also uses a sp ecific outline to define the elements  of each annex. When the format
is followed, EOP users can find information in the pl an more easily because the same type of information
is in the same location. The traditional EOP format is flexible enough to accommodate all jurisdictional
strategies. The planning team can add annexes to in clude a new function or a newly identified hazard or
threat. Similarly, the team can separate an operationa l issue (e.g., mass care) into two separate annexes
(e.g., sheltering and feeding, distribution of emergency supplies).
Emergency Support Function Format
The ESF format is the plan structure used in the NRF. Many state-level EOPs use this format.

It begins
with a basic plan, includes unique annexes that s upport the whole plan, addresses individual ESF annexes,
and then attaches separate support or incident annexes (see Figure 3.2 ).
  3-5
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Figure 3.2: Emergency Support Function EOP Format
The basic plan provides an overview of the jurisd iction’s emergency management system. It briefly
explains the hazards faced, capabilities, requirements, and the jurisdiction’s emergency management
structure. It also reviews expected mission execution for each emergency phase and identifies the
agencies that have the lead for a given ESF. The basic plan then outlines the ESFs activated during an
emergency.
3-6
3. Format and Function: Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
The ESF annexes identify the ESF coordinator and the primary and support agencies for each function.
ESFs with multiple primary agencies should designate an ESF coordinator to coordinate pre-incident
planning. An ESF annex describes expected mission execution for each emergency phase and identifies
tasks assigned to members of the ESF, including  nongovernmental and private sector partners.
The support annexes describe the framework through which a jurisdiction’s departments and agencies, the
private sector, not-for-profit and voluntary organi zations, and other nongovernmental organizations
coordinate and execute the common emergency manage ment strategies. The actions described in the
support annexes apply to nearly every type of emer gency. Each support annex identifies a coordinating
agency, as well as assisting and cooperating agencies. In some instances, two departments or agencies
share coordinating agency responsibilities. The hazard-, threat-, or incident-specific annex es describe the policies, situation, CONOPS, and
responsibilities for particular hazards, threats, or in cidents. Each annex should consider the following
components:
• Policies . The policy section identifies the authorities unique to the incident type, the special actions or
declarations that may result, and any special policies that may apply.
• Situation. The situation section describes the incident or hazard characteristics and the planning
assumptions. It also outlines the management appr oach for those instances when key assumptions do
not hold (e.g., how authorities will operate if th ey lose communication with senior decision makers).
• Concept of Operations .

This section describes the flow of the emergency management strategy for
accomplishing a mission or set of objectives in order to reach a desired end-state. It identifies special
coordination structures, specialized response team s or resources needed, and other considerations
unique to the type of incident or hazard.
• Responsibilities . Each incident annex identifies the coordinating and cooperating agencies involved
in an incident-, hazard-, or threat-specific response.
Agency-/Department-Focused Format
The agency-/department-focused format addresses each department’s or agency’s tasks in a separate
section. In addition to the basic plan, this format includes lead and support agency sections and hazard-
specific procedures for the individual agencies (see Figure 3.3 ). Very small communities may find this
format more appropriate for their situation than the other formats previously presented.
  3-7
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Figure 3.3: Agency-/Department-Focused EOP Format
Like the other EOP formats, the basic plan provides an overview of a jurisdic tion’s ability to prevent,
protect against, respond to, and recover from emergenci es. It summarizes the basic tasks taken to prepare
for a disaster and defines how the plan is developed and maintained.
 Separate lead and support agency sections discuss the emergency functions completed by individual
departments, agencies, and nongovernmental partners. E ach individual agency section still needs to refer
to other agency sections to ensure coordination with their respective emergency management strategies. The hazard-specific procedures section addresses the unique preparedness, response, and recovery strategies relevant to each department or agency for specific disaster types. The hazard-specific
procedures can immediately follow each agency section or  be attached as a separat e chapter to the plan.
This format allows EOP users to review only those pr ocedures specific to their agency without having to
review other agencies’ response tasks. The individual sections still reference the unique relationships that
need to exist with other agencies during a disaster; however, they do not contain details on the other
departments’ or agencies’ strategies. If needed, th e plan users can go to the other departments’ or
agencies’ sections and review their procedures to understand the bigger picture. The level of detail
provided in each section varies according to the needs of the specific department or agency.

Agencies or departments with detailed SOPs/SOGs may not need much information in their portion of the plan, while others may need to provide more details in the EOP.

3. Format and Function: Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
Using Planning Templates
Managers and planners, particularly at the local level, recognize that the planning process demands a
significant commitment of time, effort, and resources. To ease this burden, many planners and
jurisdictions use templates to complete their plan s. Some states provide templates to their local
jurisdictions. Other templates are available through hazard-specific preparedness programs or commercially from private sector vendors.
Planners must ensure that using those templates does not undermine the planning process. For example, “fill-in-the-blank” templates can defeat the socializati on, mutual learning, and role acceptance that are so
important to achieving effective planning and a successf ul response. The best templates are those that
offer a plan format and describe the content that each  section might contain, allowing for tailoring to the
jurisdiction’s geographic, political, and social environm ent. With this in mind, planners should consider
CPG 101 a template because it provides plan formats and content guidance. When using a planning template, pl anners should consider whether:
• The resulting plan represents the jurisdiction’s unique hazard and threat situation by ensuring that the underlying facts and assumptions match those applicable to the jurisdiction
• The hazard and risk assessments match the jurisdic tion’s demographics, infrastructure inventory,
probability of hazard occurrence, etc.
• The template broadly identifies the resources n eeded to address the problems generated by an
emergency or disaster
• Using the template stifles creativity and flexibility,  thereby constraining the development of strategies
and tactics needed to solve disaster problems
• Using the templates encourages planning “in a vacuum,” by allowing a single individual to “write” the plan.
Regardless of the template used, planners will likely disc over that the template will need to be adjusted to
meet their jurisdiction’s needs. This observation does not  mean that planners should not use templates or
plans from other jurisdictions to help with writing styl e and structure.

Instead, what it does mean is that
planners must evaluate the usefulness of any planning tool (e.g., template, software) used as part of the
planning process.
Additional Types of Plans
Emergency operations involve several kinds of plans, just as they involve several kinds of actions. While
the EOP is often the centerpiece of emergency planni ng efforts, it is not the only plan that addresses
emergency management or homeland security missions. There are other types of plans that support and
supplement the EOP and its annexes.
 Joint Operational Plans or Regional Coordination Plans typically involve multiple levels of government to address a specific incident or a special  event. These plans should be developed in a manner
consistent with this Guide and included as an anne x or supplemental plan to the EOP, depending on the
subject of the plan. Standing plans should be an a nnex to the related EOPs, while special events plans
should be stand-alone supplements based on the information contained with in the related EOPs.
Administrative plans describe basic policies and procedures to support a governmental endeavor.
Typically, they deal less with external work produc ts than with internal processes. Examples include
  3-9
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
plans for financial management, pe rsonnel management, records review, and labor relations activities.
Such plans are not the direct concern of an EOP. However, planners should reference the administrative
plan in the EOP if its provisions apply during an em ergency. Planners should make similar references in
the EOP for exceptions to normal administrative plans permitted during an emergency. Preparedness plans address the process for developing and maintaining capabilities for the whole
community both pre- and post-incident. Prep aredness plans should address capabilities needed for
prevention, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation activities. These plans include the schedule for identifying and meeting training needs based on the expectations created by the EOP; the process and
schedule for developing, conducting, and evaluating exercises and correcting identified deficiencies; and plans for procuring, retrofitting, or building faciliti es and equipment that could withstand the effects of
the hazards facing the jurisdiction. Continuity plans  outline essential functions that must be performed during an incident that disrupts
normal operations and the methods by which these func tions will be performed.

They also describe the
process for timely resumption of normal operations once the emergency has ended. COOP plans address the continued performance of core capabilities and cr itical operations during any potential incident. COG
plans address the preservation and/or reconstitution of government to ensure that constitutional,
legislative, and/or administra tive responsibilities are maintained.
 Recovery plans  developed prior to a disaster enable jurisdic tions to effectively direct recovery activities
and expedite a unified recovery effort. Pre-incident  planning performed in conjunction with community
development planning helps to establish recovery priorities, incorporate mitigation strategies in the wake of an incident, and identify options and changes that should be considered or implemented after an incident. Post-incident community reco very planning serves to integrate the range of complex decisions in
the context of the incident and works as the foundation for allocating resources.
 Mitigation plans  outline a jurisdiction’s strategy for mitig ating the hazards it faces. The Disaster
Mitigation Act of 2000 requires jurisdictions seeking certain disaster assistance funding to have approved
mitigation plans. Mitigation planning is often a long-term effort and may be part of or tied to the
jurisdiction’s strategic development plan or similar documents. Mitigation planning committees may differ from operational planning teams in that they include zoning boards, floodplain managers, and individuals with long-term cultural or economic in terests. Existing plans for mitigating hazards are
relevant to an EOP since both originate from a h azard-based analysis and share similar component
requirements.
Prevention and protection plans  typically tend to be more facility focused and procedural or tactical in
their content. Common jurisdictional prevention and protection plans include fusion center operations
plans, sector-specific or CIKR security plans, and incident-specific c ontingency action plans.
Procedural Documents
Procedural documents describe how to accomplish specific activities needed to finish a task or achieve a
goal or objective. Put simply, plans describe the “w hat” and procedures describe the “how.” Planners
should prepare procedural documents to keep the pl an free of unnecessary detail. The basic criterion is:
What does the audience of this part of the plan need to know or have set out as a matter of public record? Information and how-to instructions used by an indi vidual or small group should appear in procedural
documents.

The plan should reference procedural documents as appropriate.
With regard to many responsibilities in the EOP, it is enough to assign the responsibility to an individual
(by position or authority) or organization and specify the assignee’s accountability: to whom does the
3-10
3. Format and Function: Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
person report or with whom does the person coordina te? For example, a plan assigning responsibility for
extinguishing fires to the fire department would not detail procedures used at the scene or specify what
fire equipment is most appropriate. In this situa tion, the EOP would defer to the fire department’s
SOPs/SOGs. However, the plan would describe the relationship between the Incident Commander and the
central organization directing the jurisdictional respon se to the emergency, of which the fire in question
may be only a part.
 Overviews are brief concept summaries of an incident-rela ted function, team, or capability. There are two
types of overview documents. One type explains general protocols and procedures. This document serves
as the bridge between all functional or hazard-specific  planning annexes and procedural documentation. It
could contain an EOC layout, describe activation le vels, and identify which f unctions or sections are
responsible for planning, operati onal, and support activities. An easy way to develop an overview
document is to review the assignments and responsib ilities outlined in the EOP and ensure that the
overview document references the procedures develope d to fulfill them. The second type of overview
document is specific to a functional team or area. It describes the general responsibilities and tasks of a
functional team. This overview document provides enough  information to supporting personnel to aid in
activities related to the function, team, or cap ability summarized by the document. It identifies
qualifications to support the team, provides a summary  of operational procedures, and defines possible
missions in greater detail than is described in pl an annexes. As an example, the overview document
addressing transportation would describe the purpose of  this function, compos ition of support personnel,
requirements for the team or branch, and missions that might be required. It might also identify the
hazards or conditions that determine when missions are assigned.

A successful overview document helps orient a newly arriving member of the department or agency brought in to support a particular function, mission, or section. Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)/Standard
Operating Guidelines (SOG)  are complete reference
documents that provide the purpose, authorities,
duration, and details of the preferred method for performing a single function or a number of
interrelated functions in a uniform manner.
SOPs/SOGs often describe processes that evolved institutionally over the years or document common practices so that institutional experience is not lost to the organization as a result of staff turnover. SOPs/SOGs are sometimes task-specific (e.g., how to activate a siren system or issue an Emergency Alert
System [EAS] message). SOPs/SOGs should grow na turally out of the responsibilities identified and
described in the EOP. Staff members who typically engage in emergency activities should develop the
procedures found in an SOP/SOG. SOPs/SOGs may include checklists, call-down
rosters, resource listings, maps, and charts.
SOPs/SOGs may also describe how to notify
staff; how to obtain  and use equipment,
supplies, and vehicles; how to obtain mutual aid; how to report information  to organizational work
centers and the EOC; and how to communicate with staff members who are operating from more tha n one location.
The planning team works with the senior representatives of tasked or ganizations to ensure that the
SOPs/SOGs needed to implement the EOP do, in fact, exist and do not conflict with the EOP or with one
another. Field Operations Guides (FOG) or handbooks  are durable pocket or desk guides containing information
required to perform specific assignments or functions. FOGs provide those individuals assigned to specific teams, branches, or functions with informati on about the procedures they are likely to perform or
portions of an SOP/SOG appropriate for the missions they are likely to complete. The FOG is a short-
form version of the SOP/SOG and serves as a res ource document. When combined with the overview
document, it gives an accurate and complete picture of  the positions these individuals fill.

In addition to
relevant procedures, the FOG or handbook may include administrative procedures that staff must follow.
  3-11
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Job aids  are checklists or other materials that help users perform a task. Examples of job aids include
telephone rosters, report templates, software or machine operating instructions, and task lists. Job aids are
often included to help relatively inexperienced EO C personnel complete their assigned tasks or as a
reference for experienced personnel. Job aids may also  reduce complexity or the opportunity for error in
executing a task (e.g., providing a lookup chart of temperature conversions rather than providing a
formula for doing the conversion). These job aids do not eliminate the need for training, but may serve to
address gaps in training during an incident.
Emergency Operations Plan Content
The Basic Plan
The basic plan provides an overview of the jurisdiction’s approach to emergency operations. It identifies emergency response policies, describes the response or ganization, and assigns tasks. Although the basic
plan guides the development of the more operationally-o riented annexes, its primary audience consists of
the jurisdiction’s senior official, his or her staff, agency heads, and the commun ity (as appropriate). The
elements listed in this section should meet the n eeds of this audience while providing a solid foundation
for the development of supporting annexes.
Introductory Material
Certain items that enhance accountability and ease of use should preface an EOP. Typical introductory
material includes the following components:
• Cover Page . The cover page has the title of the plan. It should include a date and identify the
jurisdiction(s) covered by the plan.
• Promulgation Document . Promulgation is the process that offi cially announces/declares a plan (or
law). The promulgation document gives the plan official status. It gives both the authority and the
responsibility to organizations to perform their t asks. It should also mention the responsibilities of
tasked organizations with regard to preparing and maintaining their own procedures/guidelines and
commit those organizations to carrying out the trai ning, exercises, and plan maintenance needed to
support the plan. In addition, the promulgation docu ment allows senior officials to affirm their
support for emergency management.
• Approval and Implementation Page .

The approval and implementation page introduces the plan,
outlines its applicability, and indicates that it super sedes all previous plans. It should include a
delegation of authority for specific modifications that can be made to the plan and by whom they can
be made without the senior official’s signature. It should also include a date and should be signed by
the senior official(s) (e.g., governor, tribal lead er[s], mayor, county judge, commissioner[s]).
• Record of Changes . Each update or change to the plan should be tracked. The record of changes,
usually in table format, contains, at a minimum, a ch ange number, the date of the change, the name of
the person who made the change, and a summary of the change. Other relevant information could be
considered.
• Record of Distribution . The record of distribution, usually in  table format, indicates the title and the
name of the person receiving the plan, the agency to which the recipient belongs, the date of delivery,
and the number of copies delivered. Other relevant information could be considered. The record of
distribution can be used to prove that tasked i ndividuals and organizations  have acknowledged their
receipt, review, and/or acceptance of the plan. Copies of the plan can be made available to the public
and media without SOPs/SOGs, call-down lis ts, or other sensitive information.
3-12
3. Format and Function: Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
• Table of Contents . The table of contents should be a logically  ordered and clearly identified layout of
the major sections and subsections of the plan th at will make finding information within the plan
easier.
Purpose, Scope, Situation Overview, and Planning Assumptions
The purpose, scope, situation overview, and pl anning assumptions section includes the following
components:
• Purpose . The purpose sets the foundation for the rest of the EOP. The basic plan’s purpose is a
general statement of what the EOP is meant to do. The statement should be supported by a brief
synopsis of the basic plan and annexes.
• Scope .

The EOP should also explicitly state the scope  of emergency and disaster response and the
entities (e.g., departments, agencies, private sector , citizens) and geographic areas to which the plan
applies.
• Situation Overview . The situation section characterizes the “planning environment,” making it clear
why an EOP is necessary. The level of detail is a matter of judgment; some information may be
limited to a few specific annexes and presented there. At a minimum, the situation section should
summarize hazards faced by the jurisdiction and discu ss how the jurisdiction expects to receive (or
provide) assistance within its regional response stru ctures. The situation section covers a general
discussion of:
– Relative probability and impact of the hazards
– Geographic areas likely to be affected by particular hazards
– Vulnerable critical facilities (e.g., nursing homes, schools, hospitals, infrastructure)
– Population distribution and locations, including any concentrated populations of individuals with
disabilities, others with access and functional n eeds, or individuals with limited English
proficiency, as well as unaccompanied minors a nd children in daycare and school settings
– Dependencies on other jurisdictions for critical resources
– The process used by the jurisdiction to determine its capabilities and limits in order to prepare for
and respond to the defined hazards
– The actions taken in advance to minimize an inci dent’s impacts, including short- and long-term
strategies.
• Planning Assumptions . These identify what the planning team assumes to be facts for planning
purposes in order to make it possible to execute the EOP. During operations, the assumptions indicate
areas where adjustments to the plan have to be made as the facts of the incident become known. These also provide the opportunity to communicate th e intent of senior officials regarding emergency
operations priorities.
Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
The audience for the basic plan need s to be able to visualize the sequence and scope of the planned
emergency response. The CONOPS section is a written or graphic statement that explains in broad terms
the decision maker’s or leader’s intent with rega rd to an operation. The CONOPS should describe how
the response organization accomplishes a mission or set of objectives in order to reach a desired end-state.
Ideally, it offers clear methodology to realize the goals and objectives to execute the plan.

This may
include a brief discussion of the activation levels iden tified by the jurisdiction for its operations center.
The CONOPS should briefly address direction and control, alert and warning, and continuity matters that
may be dealt with more fully in annexes.
  3-13
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Organization and Assignment of Responsibilities
The basic plan establishes the operational organization that will be relied on to respond to an emergency
situation. It includes a list of the kinds of tasks to  be performed, by position and organization, without all
of the procedural details included in functional annexes. When two or more organizations perform the same kind of task, one should be given primary r esponsibility, with the other(s) providing a supporting
role. For the sake of clarity, a matrix of organiza tions and areas of responsibility (including functions)
should be included to summarize the primary and sup porting roles. Shared general responsibilities, such
as developing SOPs/SOGs, should not be neglected, and the matrix might include organizations not under jurisdictional control, if they have  defined responsibilities for responding to emergencies that might occur
in the jurisdiction. Organization charts, especially t hose depicting how a jurisdiction is implementing the
ICS or Multiagency Coordination System structure, ar e helpful. This section should also outline agency
and departmental roles related to prevention and protection activities. In addition, this section is where a jurisdiction discu sses the option that it uses for organizing emergency
management—ESF, agency and depa rtment, functional areas of ICS/NIMS, or a hybrid. The selected
management structure determines what types of annexes are included in the EOP and should be carried through to any hazard annexes.
Direction, Control, and Coordination
This section describes the framework for all direction, control, and coordination activities. It identifies
who has tactical and operational control of res ponse assets. Additionally, Direction, Control, and
Coordination explains how multijurisd ictional coordination systems support the efforts of organizations to
coordinate efforts across jurisdictions while allowing each jurisdiction to retain its own authorities.

This
section also provides information on how department and agency plans nest into the EOP (horizontal
integration) and how higher-level plans are expected to layer on the EOP (vertical integration).
Information Collection, Analysis, and Dissemination
This section describes the critical or essential information common to a ll operations identified during the
planning process. It identifies the type of information needed, the source of the information, who uses the
information, how the information is shared, the format for providing the information, and any specific times the information is needed. State and local prevention and protection assets must develop the Information Collection, Analysis, and Dissemination section in close cooperation with each other. The
contents of this section are best provided in a tabul ar format. This section may be expanded as an annex.
Communications
This section describes the communication protocols a nd coordination procedures used between response
organizations during emergencies and disaster s. It discusses the framework for delivering
communications support and how the jurisdiction’s comm unications integrate into the regional or national
disaster communications network. It does not describ e communications hardware or specific procedures
found in departmental SOPs/SOGs. Planners shoul d identify and summarize separate interoperable
communications plans. This section may be expande d as an annex and is usually supplemented by
communications SOPs/SOGs and field guides.
Administration, Finance, and Logistics
This section covers general support requirements and the availability of services and support for all types
of emergencies, as well as general policies for mana ging resources. Planners should address the following
in this section of the plan:
• References to intrastate and interstate MAAs, including the Emergency Management Assistance
Compact
3-14
3.

Format and Function: Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
• Authorities for and policies on augmenting sta ff by reassigning public employees and soliciting
volunteers, along with relevant liability provisions
• General policies on keeping financial records, repor ting, tracking resource needs, tracking the source
and use of resources, acquiring ownership of resources, and compensating the owners of private
property used by the jurisdiction.
 If this section is expanded, it shoul d be broken into individual functi onal annexes—one for each element.
Plan Development and Maintenance
This section discusses the overall approach to pla nning and the assignment of plan development and
maintenance responsibilities. This section should:
• Describe the planning process, participants in that process, and how deve lopment and revision of
different “levels” of the EOP (basic plan, anne xes, and SOPs/SOGs) are coordinated during the
preparedness phase
• Assign responsibility for the overall planning  and coordination to a specific position
• Provide for a regular cycle of training, eval uating, reviewing, and updating of the EOP.
Authorities and References
This section provides the legal basis for emergency operations and activities. This section of the plan
includes:
• Lists of laws, statutes, ordinances, executive orders , regulations, and formal agreements relevant to
emergencies (e.g., MAAs)
• Specification of the extent and limits of the emergency authorities granted to the senior official,
including the conditions under which these authoriti es become effective and when they would be
terminated
• Pre-delegation of emergency authorities (i.e., enab ling measures sufficient to ensure that specific
emergency-related authorities can be exercised by the elected or appointed leadership or their
designated successors)
• Provisions for COOP and COG (e.g., the succession of decision-making authority and operational
control) to ensure that critical em ergency functions can be performed.
Supporting Annexes
What follows is a discussion of the purpose and potential content of supporting annexes to the basic plan.

For consistency, the recommended structure for all annexes is the same as that of the basic plan.
Functional, Support, Emergency Phase, or Agency-Focused Annex Content
Functional, support, emergency phase, or agency-focu sed annexes add specific information and direction
to the EOP. These annexes are variations of functional annexes tailored to the EOP format used by the
jurisdiction. They focus on critical operational func tions and who is responsib le for carrying them out.
These annexes clearly describe the policies, process es, roles, and responsibilities that agencies and
departments carry out before, during, and after any emergency. While the basic plan provides broad,
overarching information relevant to the EOP as a wh ole, these annexes focus on specific responsibilities,
tasks, and operational actions that pertain to th e performance of a particular emergency operations
function. These annexes also establish preparedness ta rgets (e.g., training, exercises, equipment checks
  3-15
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
and maintenance) that facilitate achieving function-
related goals and objectives  during emergencies and
disasters. Planners should ensure that  specific concerns
of population segments, such as children and
individuals with access and functional needs,
are addressed in specific functional, support,
emergency phase, or agency-focused annexes. For example:
Incorporating specific sheltering
considerations for individuals with access
and functional
needs
Incorporating means and methods by which
transportation requests from schools are
received and processed
Incorporating mechanisms for disseminating
accessible emergency public  information
using multiple methods to reach individ
uals
with sensory and cognitive disabilities, as
well as individuals with limited Engl ish
proficiencyAn early and very important planning task is to identify
the functions that are critical to successful emergency response. These core functions become the subjects of the separate functional, support, emergency phase, or agency-focused annexes. The constitutional and
organizational structures of a jurisdiction’s government,
the capabilities of its emergency services agencies, and established policy and intended outcome of emergency operations influence the choice of core functions.

While no single list of functions applies to all jurisdictions, the
following list of core functions warrants special
attention because they may require specific actions during emergency response operations:
•Direction, control, and coordination
•Information collection, analysis, and dissemination
•Communications
•Population warning
•Emergency public information
•Public protection
•Mass care and emergency assistance
•Health and medical services
•Resource management.
This list of core functions is not comprehensive. Each jurisdiction must assess its own needs, and
additional or different annexes from those identified in Appendix C should be prepared at the planning team’s discretion. States should encourage their jurisd ictions to use a consistent set of core emergency
functions to facilitate coordination and interoperability.
Some jurisdictions may want to modify their functional annex structure to use the 15 ESFs identified in
the NRF. Some communities that have adopted the ESF approach have also added additional ESFs to
meet local needs. The ESF structure facilitates the orderly flow of local requests for governmental support
to the state and Federal levels and the provision of  resources back down to local government during an
emergency. State and local jurisdictions that choose not to adopt the ESF structure should cross-reference
their functional annexes with the ESFs.
Table 3.1  shows some possible  relationships between the traditi onal emergency management core
functions, the department/agency, and ESF structures.

Hazard-, Threat-, or Incident-Specific Annexes
The contents of hazard-, threat-, or incident-sp ecific annexes focus on the special planning needs
generated by the subject hazard., These annexes contai n unique and regulatory response details that apply
to a single hazard. Depending upon the EOP’s structure, hazard-specific information may be included in
functional annexes rather than sta nd-alone hazard-specific annexes.
 Hazard- or incident-specific annexes usually identify hazard-specific risk areas and evacuation routes, specify provisions and protocols for warning the pub lic and disseminating emergency public information,
and specify the types of protective equipment and detection devices for responders. The annexes have
tabs that serve as work aids for items including maps , charts, tables, checklists, resource inventories, and
summaries of critical information. As indicated pr eviously, hazard-specific annexes follow the basic
plan’s content organization. Hazard-specific operations  information is typically provided in the CONOPS
section, and includes:
• Assessment and control of the hazard
• Identification of unique prevention and CIKR protect ion activities to be undertaken to address the
hazard or threat, as appropriate
• Selection of protective actions
• Conduct of public warning
• Implementation of protective actions
• Implementation of short-term stabilization actions
• Implementation of recovery actions.
Annex Implementing Instructions
Each annex, as well as the basic plan, may use impl ementing instructions in the form of SOPs/SOGs,
maps, charts, tables, forms, and checklists and may be included as attachments or references.

The EOP
planning team may use supporting documents, as needed, to clarify the contents of the plan or annex. For
example, the evacuation annex may be made clearer by  attaching maps marked with evacuation routes to
it. Because these routes may change depending on the location of the hazard, hazard-specific maps may
also be included in the evacuation annex. Similarly,  the locations of shelters may be marked on maps
supporting the mass care annex.

3. Format and Function: Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
Special Preparedness Programs
Some jurisdictions participate in special preparedn ess programs that publish their own planning guidance.
Two examples are the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program and the Radiological
Emergency Preparedness Program. When participating jurisdictions are developing an EOP, they must
ensure that they meet the special planning require ments of these programs. Jurisdictions must decide
whether this compliance is best accomplished by  incorporating the requirements across functional
annexes or by developing a hazard-specific annex for the program.

4. The Planning Process
Overview
This chapter merges information from the first three chapters and describes an approach for operational
planning that is consistent with processes already fa miliar to most planners. Wh en the planning process is
used consistently during the preparedness phase, its use during operations becomes second nature. The
goal is to make the planning process routine acro ss all phases of emergency management and for all
homeland security mission areas.
The process described in this chapter blends concepts from a variety of s ources. It applies at all levels of
government and allows private and nongovernmental orga nizations to integrate with government planning
efforts. Although individual planners can use this proc ess, it is most effective when used by a planning
team.
Steps in the Planning Process
There are many ways to produce an EOP. The pla nning process that follows is flexible and allows
communities to adapt it to varying characteristics and s ituations. While not ideal, if time is a constraint,
steps can be minimized or skipped in order to accel erate the process. Small communities can follow just
the steps that are appropriate to their size, known risks, and available planning resources.

Figure 4.1
depicts steps in the planning process. At each step in the planning pr ocess, jurisdictions should consider
the impact of the decisions made on training, exercises, equipment, and other requirements.
Figure 4.1: Steps in the Planning Process
  4-1
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Step 1: Form a Collaborative Planning Team Case Study: A Small Community
Planning Team
A small community took the following
approach to forming its planning team:
Who was involved in the core planning
team?
The core planning team was composed of
any department or office that was likely to be involved in most, if not all, responses. The five to seven most central people in
this community were: the Fire and Police
Chiefs, the Emergency Manager and the Planner, and the Head of Public Works.
What did they do?
Studied the composition of the
population
within the community
Provided information to create a
complete draft plan
Answered questions about the
community
 for the draft plan
Provided additional commentary on
roles and respons
ibilities
Gave information about the
community’s standard operations
Clarified command structures
Provided information about resources,
capabilities, threats, and risks
Gave writers information for integration
Who participated in the expanded
planning team?
The expanded planning team included
responders and stakeholders who might become involved in a major incident. In this case, the community used a 10- to 20-
member group that included emergency
managers from surrounding communities, business leaders, secondary responders, representatives from industry, community
leaders (including leaders from the
disability community), and community contractors.
What did they do?
Reviewed  the full plan
Provided insights and
recommendations for improvement
Integrated additional perspectives
Agreed to provide additional supportExperience and lessons learned indicate that operational
planning is best performed by a team. Using a team or group approach helps organizations define the role they will play
during an operation. Case studies and research reinforce this
concept by pointing out that the common thread found in
successful operations is that pa rticipating organizations have
understood and accepted their roles.

In addition, members of the planning team should be able to understand and accept the roles of other departments and agencies. One goal of
using a planning team is to build and expand relationships
that help bring creativity and innovation to planning during an incident. This approach help s establish a planning routine,
so that processes followed before an incident occurs are the
same as those used during and following an incident.
A community benefits from the active participation of all
stakeholders. Some tips for gathering the team together include the following:
•Plan ahead . The planning team should receive plenty of
notice about where and when the planning meeting will
be held. If time permits, ask the team members to
identify the time(s) and place(s) that will work for thegroup.
•Provide information about team expectations . Planners
should explain why participating on the planning team isimportant to the participants’ agencies and to thecommunity itself, showing the participants how their
contributions will lead to more effective operations. In
addition, budget and other pr oject management concerns
should be outlined early in the process.
•Ask the senior elected or appointed official or designee
to sign the meeting announcement . A directive from the
executive office carries the author ity of the senior official
and sends a clear signal that the participants are expected
to attend and that operational planning is important to the
community.
•Allow flexibility in scheduling after the first meeting .
Not all team members will need to attend all meetings. Insome cases, task forces or  subcommittees can complete
the work. When the planning team chooses to use thisoption, it should provide project guidance (e.g., timeframes, milestones) but let the subcommittee membersdetermine when it is most convenient to meet.
•Consider using external facilitators . Third-party
facilitators can perform a vital function by keeping the
process focused and mediating disagreements.
4-2
4. The Planning Process
The key to planning in a group setting is to allow open and frank discussion during the process.
Interaction among planners can help elicit a co mmon operational unders tanding. Individual group
members must be encouraged to express objections or doubts.

If a planner disagrees with a proposed solution, that planner must also identify what needs to be fixed.
Identify Core Planning Team
In most jurisdictions, the emergency manager or homel and security manager is the senior official’s policy
advisor for prevention, protection, response, rec overy, and mitigation strategies, as well as overall
preparedness. The emergency manager or homeland s ecurity manager may also be the prevention and
protection advisor, if that role is not given to a law enforcement official or other designated advisor. In
these roles, emergency managers or homeland security  managers are often responsible for coordinating
and developing an EOP, filling the role of lead plan ner. This means that the emergency manager provides
oversight to a jurisdiction’s planning team. Howeve r, other government agencies or departments may
have statutory authority and responsibility that overlaps or complements this responsibility. For example,
law enforcement often has the lead in addressing pr evention and protection, while public health addresses
unique epidemiological issues.
It is important to include a hazard mitigation expe rt on the planning team. Mitigation planners are a
valuable resource for information concerning hazard an alysis, functional vulnerabilities, critical facilities,
and funding availability. Includi ng mitigation promotes continuity throughout emergency planning and
helps reduce the number of physical constraints by leveraging resources to address anticipated operational
requirements. Increasingly, emergency management agencies are hiring permanent staff and/or contracting subject
matter experts to provide expertise on disability, acce ss and functional needs, children, and household
pets and service animals for the emergency planning process. These experts provide critical perspectives
and information to ensure individuals with disab ilities, others with access and functional needs, and
individuals with limited English proficiency are fully integrated into EOPs.

These experts can also help
ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws.
Even at this early stage, planners
should begin thinking about the impact
of who is involved in the planning process, as it will have a major impact
on preparedness and operational
requirements.
For example, if there is no hazardous
materials response capability in a
jurisdiction, planners will need to consider how to obtain that capability (through agreements)  or develop that
capability (through equipment, training, licensing, etc.).
Conversely, failure to include groups
in planning (such as advocates for
those with access or functional needs) will lead to mistakes and/or shortfalls
in capability and resource
requirements. The planner must ensure that operational planning involves the
jurisdiction’s entire emergency management and homeland security team. Initially, the team should be small, consisting of
planners from the organizations that usually participate in emergency or homeland security operations. They form the core for all planning efforts. As an EOP matures, the core team
expands to include other planners.
Jurisdictions that use an agency and department operational
structure might use a core team consisting of planners from the following:
•Emergency management
•Law enforcement
•Fire services
•EMS
•Public health
4-3
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
• Hospitals and health care facilities
• Public works
• Utility operators
• Education
• Agriculture
• Animal control
• Social services
• Childcare, child welfare, and juvenile  justice facilities (including courts)
• National Guard
• Private sector
• Civic, social, faith-based, educational, professiona l, and advocacy organizations (e.g., those that
address disability and access and functional needs issues, children’s issues, immigrant and
racial/ethnic community concerns, animal welfare, and service animals).
A jurisdiction might want to base the core planning team’s membership on the EOP structure it uses. For example, jurisdictions using an ESF structure might form  a core team composed of planners from the lead
agencies or departments for ESF #4 (Fire), ESF #5 (Emergency Management), ESF #6 (Mass Care), ESF #8 (Public Health and Medical Services), and ESF #13 (Public Safety). Note that these ESF titles are
examples.

While the Federal naming convention is pref erred for consistency, a jurisdiction should use its
local ESF naming convention in its plans. Regardless of the core planning team structure, the involvement of executives from the member agencies,
departments, or CIKR organizations (where appropriate) is critical. They are able to speak with authority
on policy, provide subject matter expertise, and pr ovide accountability as it relates to their agency or
department.
Engaging the Whole Community in Planning
Engaging in community-based planning—planning that is for the whole community and involves the
whole community—is crucial to the success of any pl an. Determining how to effectively engage the
community in this planning process is one of the bi ggest challenges faced by planners. This challenge
may be built on misperceptions about a community’s in terest in participating in the process, security
concerns about involving those outside government, or a failure to jointly and adequately define the role
of the community in the planning process. Community leaders have a keen understanding about their community’s needs and capabilities and are a valuable  stakeholder that can support the planning process
in many ways. Community-based planning should also include notifying affected, protected groups of
opportunities to participate in planning activities a nd making such activities accessible to the entire
community (e.g., use of interprete rs and translated announcements).
Communities may or may not be geographically cons trained. Geographic communities are generally the
basis for emergency management agencies and are constructed around political boundaries. The geographic community includes a number of communities of interest. These communities of interest are
not necessarily confined to the borders of a jurisdic tion and may center on physical, social, cultural, or
philosophical structures. Examples include:
• Civic, social, faith-based, educational, professional, and advocacy organizations
4-4
4. The Planning Process
• Immigrant and limited English proficiency constituencies Case Studies: Private Sector
Partnerships
Arlington County, Virginia has developed the “Safer Arlington
Partnership,” a program engaging
non-profit, private sector, and public sector organizations in which members work together to enhance
the level of preparedness in the
County.

The program’s mission is achieved through four task forces:
Training and Exercises, Information
and Tools, Resource Inventory and Management, and Education and Outreach. More information regarding
this initiative can be found at
http://www.fema.gov/ pdf/privatesector/
safer_arlington_partnership.pdf.
Several large metropolitan areas have
also integrated the private sector into their catastrophic planning activities, including Honolulu (pandemic
planning), Los Angeles/ Long Beach
(disaster housing), National Capital Region (evacuation and contra-flow),
New York/New Jersey (infrastructure
protection, disaster housing), Norfolk (commodities and resource management), and Seattle
(evacuation and sheltering). • Voluntary organizations
• Private service providers
• Critical infrastructure operators
• Local and regional corporations.
The private sector is a critical component in community engagement. Not only are they often the primary providers of
critical services to the public, they also possess knowledge and
resources to supplement and enhance preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. Often, private sector and government missions overlap—early coordination ensures effective sharing of information and resources and facilitates the establishment of
common goals and objectives.
 Private sector engagement presents unique challenges. The private sector plays a critical role in any disaster, and it is important to ensure they are active particip ants in the process, including
involvement in jurisdictional training and exercise programs. An effective outreach program is critical in developing these partnerships. Disasters begin and end locally. After the response is over, it is the local community that lives with the decisions made during the
incident. Therefore, communities should have a say in how a
disaster response occurs. They should also shoulder responsibility for building their community’s resilience and enhancing its
recovery before, during, and after a disaster. The community may have capabilities and resources that do not exist in the volume
needed or at all within the traditi onal government response structure.
There are many ways to leverage the commun ity’s capabilities and knowledge in the preparedness
process. Although often viewed as a challenge , engaging the community can be successfully
accomplished when approached correctly.
The foundation for community-based pla nning is knowing the community (see Figure 4.2 ).

A keen
understanding of the actual population and its needs will have a profound effect on the success or failure
of any plan. Understanding the requirements of tho se with access and functional needs affects mass care
courses of action and the resulting plans. Additionall y, the number of children in the community will
affect the ways in which schools are used as a resour ce, in turn defining some of the requirements for
reunification planning. Engaging the community will increase the likeli hood that people follow protective
action measures during a crisis because they unders tand how plans address household pets or service
animals. Likewise, taking into account the perceptions and fears of some populations, such as
undocumented immigrants, may incr ease the plan’s effectiveness.

Figure 4.2: Community Engagement in Planning
Finally, it is critical to include civic leaders, members of the public, and representatives of community-based organizations in the planning process. They  may serve as an important resource for validating
assumptions about public needs, capabilities, and reactions. Because many planning assumptions and
response activities will directly impact the public at  large, involving the whole community during the
planning phase is essential. This involvement s hould continue during valida tion and implementation.
Potential roles include support to planning teams, public outreach, and establishing Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT). Planners can obt ain assistance for including the whole community
in the planning process from state or local Citi zen Corps Councils, as well as the Local Emergency
Planning Committee (LEPC). Pre-established partnerships and relationships are important for leveraging subject matter expertise and resources during a disaster.
4. The Planning Process
Step 2: Understand the Situation
Effective risk management depends on a consistent comparison of the hazards a particular jurisdiction
faces. This is typically performed through a threa t/hazard identification and risk assessment process that
collects information about threats and hazards and assi gns values to risk for the purposes of determining
priorities, developing or comparing courses of action,  and informing decision making. Depending on the
resources available and leadership, a jurisdic tion could conduct an in-depth process—cataloging
everything from specific asset vulne rabilities to emergency personnel sta ffing levels.

Often, however, this
level of analysis is not possible or practical; in such cases, jurisdictions should conduct a risk assessment
of achievable and appropriate scale and scope.
Identify Threats and Hazards
Planners should start the problem-solving process by conducting research and analysis on the
jurisdiction’s threats and hazards. Considering the poten tial risks a jurisdiction may face brings specificity
to the planning process. If risks are problems and operational plans are the solution, then hazard and
threat identification and analysis are key steps in the planning process.
The first step of research focuses on gathering inform ation about the jurisdiction’s planning framework,
potential risks, resource base, demographics, household pet and service animal population, and
geographic characteristics that could affect emergency operations. There are many existing resources available to support planners in this step.
Threat assessments prepared for or  by agencies may provide informa tion on potential “soft targets” and
threats within the jurisdiction. In addition, jurisdictions’ hazard mitigation plans are an excellent resource
for this step, as they are required to identify, catalog,  and analyze all natural hazards that have the ability
to impact the specified community. Jurisdictions s hould take additional steps to include human-caused
and technological hazards.
Federal and state analyses that include data about historical incidents faced by the community also
provide valuable information for this step. In addition, local organizations (e.g., the local chapter of the
American Red Cross), utilities, other businesses, and me mbers of the planning team can provide records
about their experiences.
As an additional source, planning teams can use stat e and local fusion centers to provide analytical
products, such as risk and trend analyses, that are de rived from the systematic collection and evaluation of
threat information. Fusion centers also provide access to national-level intelligence and can serve as a
mechanism to “deconflict” information.
 Sources for expertise on hazard or threat potential include jurisdictional agencies; academic, industrial,
and public interest group researchers; private consulta nts specializing in hazard or threat analysis; and
professional associations concerned with the hazards or  threats on a planner’s list. Sources of information
on the community and possible consequences from risks vary.

To determine the potential consequences of
certain facility-based hazards, planners might check with the facility owner/operator or the agency (Federal, state, territorial, tribal, local, or regional) that regulates that kind of facility. The LEPC may be
able to assist with this information. For demogra phics, census data are available, as are off-the-shelf
computer products that organize such data by zip code. Knowing the number an d type of household pets
and service animals the jurisdiction may need to accommodate during an emergency situation will also
guide preparedness activities. Sources of such data include market statistics, household pet licensing
databases, and rabies vaccination records.
  4-7
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
The planning team should also make extensive use of the existing information about the jurisdiction. For
example, the local planning and zoning commission or  department may have extensive demographic, land
use, building stock, and similar data. Building inspection offices maintain  data on the structural integrity
of buildings, codes in effect at time of construction, and the hazard effects that a code addresses. Local public works (or civil engineering) departments and utilities are sources for information on potential damage to and restoration time for the critical infr astructures threatened by hazard effects. The chamber
of commerce may offer a perspective on damage to  businesses and general economic loss. Other sources
of information mentioned previously—emergency service logs and reports, universities, professional associations, etc.—also apply.
Understanding the consequences of a potential incident requires gathering information about the potential access and functional needs of residents within the community. To begin planning, jurisdictions must have an accurate assessment—an informed estimat e of the number and types of individuals with
disabilities and others with access and functional need s residing in the community. Emergency planners
should base their assessments on lists and information collected from multiple relevant sources, such as:
• U.S.

Census data • Utility providers
• Social services listings (e.g., dialysis centers, Meals on Wheels) • Congregate settings (e.g., nursing homes, summer camps)
• Paratransit providers • Schools and universities
• Bureau of motor vehicles (accessible parking permit holders) • Medicaid
• Centers for Independent Living • Hospitals
• Home health agencies • Daycare centers (for children or senior citizens)
• Vocational rehabilitation and job access services • Places of worship
• Disability services providers • Homeless shelters
• Health or behavioral health agencies • Housing programs.
 If planners compile the numbers from various lists, often referred to as the “list of lists” concept, they will
have an estimate of the number of individuals resi ding in their communities, which will benefit planning
for sufficient transportation and sheltering. Togeth er, these lists can provide raw numbers vital to
understanding the magnitude of the community’s requi rements. Emergency managers should also gather
as much information as possible regarding the types of services these individuals require so emergency
staff can be adequately trained and resource needs can be met.
 These different types of assessments are sometimes mistak enly considered the same as registries when, in
fact, they are different. A registry is a database of individuals who voluntarily sign up and meet the
eligibility requirements for receiving emergency respon se services based on a need (the criteria for which
should be established by the jurisdiction). The next step of the threat and hazard identification process is to organize the information into a format
that is usable by the planning team. One effective me thod for organizing hazard or threat information is to
use a matrix based on dimensions used  during the risk analysis process:
• Probability or frequency of occurrence
• Magnitude (the physical force associated with the hazard or threat)
4-8
4.

The Planning Process
  4-9
• Intensity/severity (the impact or damage expected)
• Time available to warn
• Location of the incident (an area of interest or  a specific or indeterminate site or facility)
• Potential size of the affected area
• Speed of onset (how fast the hazard or threat can impact the public)
• Duration (how long the hazard or threat will be active)
• Cascading effects.
Depending on the kinds of decisions and analyses the in formation is meant to support, planners might use
other categories for data organization. For example, the decision that one hazard poses a greater threat than another may require only a qualitative estimate (e.g., high versus medium), whereas planning how to
deal with health and medical needs caused by a par ticular hazard may require estimates of likely fatalities
and injuries.
Assess Risk
The risk assessment
7 is the basis for EOP development. The
assessment helps a planning team decide what hazards or threats
merit special attention, what ac tions must be planned for, and
what resources are likely to be needed. The analysis method inventories, evaluates, and provides loss estimates for assets deemed critical during the response and recovery phases of an
incident. Planners can also obtain the Hazards U.S. Multi-Hazard
(HAZUS-MH) model from FEMA. HAZUS-MH is a nationally applicable and standardized methodology and software program that estimates potential losses from earthquakes, floods, and hurricane winds. This type of hazard assessment is similar to that which is required for hazard mitigation plans. In fact, if the
community possesses a FEMA-approved multi-hazard mitigation plan, an assessment may be readily
available. Mitigation plans can be used as referenc e documents to simplify the development of most
hazards-based analyses. The information gathered during the jurisdictional assessment of individuals with disabilities and others
with access and functional needs requires a detailed an alysis. Emergency planners need to review the
assessment findings and analyze the quantity and types of resources (including personnel) needed during
different types of incidents.

For example, a ju risdiction with a large number of limited English
proficiency residents might need to identify methods by which language assist ance will be provided (e.g.,
bilingual personnel, interpreters, translated documents) to support operati ons, such as evacuation,
sheltering, and recovery. Additionally, planners need to work with social services agencies to plan for
unaccompanied minors and to assess for types of resour ces needed for the community’s children during
and following a disaster. Hazard and threat analysis requires that the planning  team knows risks that have occurred or could occur
in the jurisdiction. The process should begin with a list  of the risks that concern planners, developed from
research conducted earlier in the planning process. A list of concerns might include those listed in Table
4.1.
7 FEMA Publication 386-2, Understanding Your Risks: Identifying Hazards and Estimating Losses, provides a detailed method for
conducting hazard and risk assess ments for many hazards. Remember that as the situation is
analyzed and hazards or threats are
prioritized, each carries with it training, equipment, and exercise requirements. It is not too early—even
if only at a high level—to consider
what is within the scope of capability of the jurisdiction and how those capabilities can be enhanced through
preparedness activities and by the
adding or sharing of resources.

Planners must keep in mind that hazard or threat lists pose two problems. The first is exclusion or
omission. There is always a potential for new and unexpected risks (part of the reason why maintaining aall-hazards, all-threats capability is important).

The sec ond is that such lists involve groupings, which can
affect subsequent analysis. A list may give the impression that hazards or threats are independent of one another, when in fact they are often related (e.g., an earthquake might cause dam failure). Lists may gr
very different causes or sequences of events that require different types of responses under one categoryFor example, “Flood” might include dam failure, cloudbursts, or heavy rain upstream. Lists also may group a whole range of consequences under the category of a singn

le hazard. “Terrorism,” for example,
ould include use of conventional explosives against pe ople or critical infrastructure; nuclear detonation;
s or
t
es,
re static. Some hazards or threat s may pose a risk to the
ommunity that is so limited that additional analysis  is not necessary. Others might be dynamic, such as
• Facts are verified pieces of information, such as la ws, regulations, terrain maps, population statistics,
resource inventories, and prior occurrences. c
or release of lethal chemical, biological, or radiological material.
 Using a risk analysis, the planning team must compare and prioritize risks to determine which hazardthreats merit special attention in planning (and other emergency and homeland security management
efforts). The team must consider the frequency of the hazard or threat and the likelihood or severity
potential of its consequences in order to develop a sing le indicator of the risk to the jurisdiction. This
effort allows for comparisons and the setting of priori ties. While a mathematical approach is possible, i
may be easier to manipulate qualitative ratings (e.g., hi gh, medium, low) or index numbers (e.g., reducing
quantitative information to a 1-to-3, 1-to-5, or 1-to-10 scale based on defined th resholds) for different
categories of information used in the ranking scheme. Some approaches involve the consideration of only
two categories—frequency and consequences—and treat th em as equally important. In other approach
potential consequences receive more weight than frequency.

While it is important to have a sense of themagnitude involved (whether in regard to the single indicator used to rank hazards or to estimate the numbers of people affected), these indicators acHAZMAT toxicity and transportation routes.
The analysis process produces facts and assumpti ons, which can be distinguished as follows:
4. The Planning Process
• Assumptions consist of information accepted by planne rs as being true in the absence of facts in order
to provide a framework or establish expected cond itions of an operational environment so that
planning can proceed. Assumptions are used as facts onl y if they are considered valid (or likely to be
true) and are necessary for solving the problem.
Incident managers replace assumptions with facts when they implement a plan. For example, when
producing a flood annex, planners may assume the loca tion of the water overflow, size of the flood hazard
area, and speed of the rise in water. When the plan is put into effect as the incident unfolds, operations
personnel replace assumptions with the facts of the s ituation and modify the plan accordingly. Planners
should use assumptions sparingly and put great effort into performing research and acquiring facts, including the use of historical precedent. The outcomes of the analysis process help planners determine goals and objectives (Step 3) and select the supporting planning concept they will use when developing the plan (Step 4).
Step 3: Determine Goals and Objectives
Determine Operational Priorities
Operational priorities  specify what the responding organizations are to accomplish to achieve a desired
end-state for the operation. The senior official may communicate desired end-states for the operations
addressed in the plans. By using information from th e risk profile developed as part of the analysis
process, the planning team engages the senior official to establish how the hazard or threat would evolve in the jurisdiction and what defines a successful outcome for responders, disaster survivors, and the
community. Starting with a given intensity for the hazard or thr eat, the team imagines an incident’s development from
prevention and protection efforts, through initial warning (if available) to its impact on the jurisdiction (as
identified through analysis) and its generation of sp ecific consequences (e.g., collapsed buildings, loss of
critical services or infrastructure, death, injury, displacement).

These scenarios should be realistic and
created on the basis of the jurisdictio n’s hazard/threat and risk data. Planners may use the incidents that
have the greatest impact on the jurisdiction (worst-case), those that are most likely to occur, or an incident
constructed from the impacts of a variety of risks. During this process of building an incident scenario,
the planning team identifies the requirements that determine actions and resources. Planners are looking
for requirements generated by the hazard or threat , the response, and by constraints/restraints.
• Requirements can be caused by the nature of the hazard or threat. They lead to functions, such as law enforcement intervention, public protection, p opulation warning, and search and rescue. Response
requirements are caused by actions taken in response to an agent-generated problem. These tend to be common to all operations. An example is the potentia l need for emergency refueling during a large-
scale evacuation. Subsets could include  the needs to find a site for refueling, identify a fuel supplier,
identify a fuel pumping method, control traffic, and collect stalled vehicles.
• A constraint is something that must be done (“must  do”), while a restraint is something that prohibits
action (“must not do”). They may be caused by a law, regulation, or management directive; some physical characteristic (e.g., terrain and road netw orks that make east-west evacuations impossible);
or resource limitations.
 Once the requirements are identified, the planning team restates them as priorities and affirms those priorities with the senior official.

Mission, Operational Priorities,
Goals, and Objectives
Plan Mission: Effectively coordinate
and direct available resources to protect the public and property from
hazards or threats.
 Operational Priority:  Protect the
public from hurricane weather and storm surge.
Goal:  Complete evac uation before
arrival of tropical storm winds.
Desired result: All self- and assisted
evacuees are safely outside of the
expected impact area prior to impact.

Objective: Complete tourist
evacuation 72 hours before arrival of
tropical storm winds.
Desired result: tourist segment of
public protected prior to hazard onset, allowing resources to be redirected to
accomplishing other objectives in
support of this goal or other goals. Goals and objectives must be carefully crafted to ensure they
support accomplishing the plan miss ion and operational priorities.
They must also clearly indicate th e desired result or end-state they
are designed to yield. This appro ach enables unity of effort and
consistency of purpose among the multiple groups and activities involved in executing the plan.
Goals  are broad, general statements that indicate the intended
solution to problems identified by planners during the previous step. They are what personnel and equipment resources are supposed to achieve. They help identify when major elements of the response are complete and when the operation is successful.
Objectives  are more specific and identifiable actions carried out
during the operation. They lead to achieving response goals and
determining the actions that par ticipants in the operation must
accomplish. Translating these objectives into activities, implementing procedures, or ope rating procedures by responsible
organizations is part of planning. As goals and objectives are set, planners may identify more requirements that will feed into the development of courses of action as well as the capability estimate (see Step 4).
Step 4: Plan Development
Develop and Analyze Courses of Action
This step is a process of generating, comparing, a nd selecting possible solutions for achieving the goals
and objectives identified in Step 3. Planners consid er the requirements, goals, and objectives to develop
several response alternatives. The art and science of  planning helps determine how many solutions or
alternatives to consider; however, at least two options should always be considered. Developing only one
solution may speed the planning process, but it will probably provide for an inadequate response, leading
to more damaging effects on the affected population or environment.
Developing courses of action uses the hybrid planning approach previously discussed. When developing
courses of actions, planners depict how an operation unfolds by building a portrait of the incident’s actions, decision points, and participant activities. Th is process helps planners identify tasks that occur
immediately at incident initiation, tasks that are more mid-incident focused, and tasks that affect long-term operations.

The planning team should work thro ugh this process by using tools that help members
visualize operational flow, such as a white board, “sticky note” chart (see Figure 4.3 ), or some type of
project management or special planning software.
4-12
4. The Planning Process
Figure 4.3: “Sticky Note” Chart
Course of action development follows these steps: Courses of Action in a Nutshell
Courses of action address the what/
who/when/where/why/how for each solution.
As each potential course of action is
identified, the planner should consider where it supports the priorities, goals, and objectives established by the
senior official. Additionally, the course
of action should be examined to determine whether it is feasible and whether the stakeholders that are
needed to implement it find it
acceptable. • Establish the timeline . Planners should cover all mission
areas in the timeline and typically use the speed of incident
onset to establish the timeline. The timeline may also change by phases. For example, a hu rricane’s speed of onset is
typically days, while a major HAZMAT incident’s speed of onset is minutes. The timeline for a hurricane might be in
hours and days, particularly during the pre- and post-impact
phases. The timeline for the HAZMAT incident would most likely be in minutes and hours. For a multijurisdictional or layered plan, the timeline for a particular scenario is the same at all participating levels of government. Placement of
decision points and response actions on the timeline depicts how soon the different entities enter the plan.
• Depict the scenario . Planners use the scenario information
developed in Step 3 and place the incident information on the timeline.
• Identify and depict decision points . Decision points indicate the place in time, as incidents unfold,
when leaders anticipate making decisions about a course of action. They indicate where and when
decisions are required to provide the best chance of achieving an intermediate objective or response
  4-13
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
goal (the desired end-state). They also help planners  determine how much time is available or needed
to complete a sequence of actions.
•Identify and depict operational tasks . For each operational task depicted, some basic information is
needed.

Developing this information helps planners incorporate the task into the plan when they are
writing it. Planners correctly identify an operati onal task when they can answer the following
questions about it:
–What is the action?
–Who is responsible for the action?
–When should the action take place?
–How long should the action take and how much time is actually available?
–What has to happen before?
–What happens after?
–What resources does the person/entity need to perform the action?
•Select courses of action. Once the above analysis is complete, planners must compare the costs and
benefits of each proposed course of action agains t the mission, goals, and objectives. Based on this
comparison, planners then select the preferred c ourses of action to move forward in the planning
process. While not necessary for every c ourse of action identified, planners should use their best
judgment and identify when the selection of a course or courses of action will need to be elevated to
the senior elected or appointed official for approval. Where practical, the appropriate official should
approve these actions prior to the review and completion of the plan.
“Red-Teaming” as a Method for Analyzing Courses of Action
A “peer review” process for plans is a useful tool fo r examining whether plans contain all of the necessary
elements. Leveraging expertise from outsi de the jurisdiction will aid in challenging assumptions and identifying
gaps in the jurisdiction’s courses of action.
For plans dealing with adaptive threat s (e.g., terrorism), examining plans “t hrough the eyes of the adversary” can
lead to significant improvements and a higher probabilit y of success.

This process is known as “red-teaming.”
Essential elements of a red-team review include:
Engaging the law enforcement community and fusion centers to act as the adversary
Understanding the operational enviro
nment (e.g., geography, demography, economy, culture)
Establishing
a potential adversary’s identity, resources, tactics, and possible courses of action
Evaluating the plan under multiple scenarios and a wide range of circumstances using tabletop exercises,
facilitated semi
nars, and computer models and simulations to aid in analysis.
Red teams should foster a culture of critical thinking , intellectualism, and self-criticism. Red team members
should be creative, objective, intellectually curious, and able to manage their egos. Red teams must act with
ingenuity and enthusiasm to develop and apply customiz ed approaches to every problem. Red teams need to
cultivate expertise, recognize the limitat ions of their own knowledge, constantly seek and evaluate new insights,
and have access to the opinions and understanding of tr uly informed experts. Finally, red teams need to avoid
being confrontational. Red team members need to work closely and solicit information from the staff; however, it
is best if they conduct their work in the background to  avoid interference from staff members who may have a
vested interested in a particular course of action.
Red-teaming is most successful when senior officials endorse and support it. Participants must be able to make
their comments in an atmosphere of c onfidentiality and non-attribution.
4-14
4. The Planning Process
  4-15 Identify Resources
Once courses of action are selected, the planning t eam identifies resources needed to accomplish tasks
without regard to resource availability. The object is to identify the resources needed to make the
operation work. Once the planning team identifies all the requirements, they begin matching available
resources to requirements. By tracking obligations  and assignments, the planning team determines
resource shortfalls and develops a list of needs that pr ivate suppliers or other jurisdictions might fill. The
resource base should also include a list of facilities vital to emergency operations, and the list should
indicate how individual hazards might affect the facilities.

Whenever possible, planners should match
resources with other geographical/regional needs so that multiple demands for the same or similar
resources can be identified and conflicts resolved. This  step provides planners an opportunity to identify
resource shortfalls to pass to higher levels of government and to prepare pre-scripted resource requests, as appropriate. The EOP should account for unsolvable r esource shortfalls so they are not just “assumed
away.” The capability estimate process is critical to this effort.
A capability estimate is a planner’s assessment of a ju risdiction’s ability to take a course of action.
Capability estimates help planners decide if pursuing a particular course of action is realistic and
supportable. They help planners better project and understand what might take  place during an operation.
Simply stated, the capability estimate represents the ca pabilities and resource types needed to complete a
set of courses of action. The resulting capability estimate will feed into the resource section of the plan or
annex. Capability estimates may be written doc uments, tables or matrices, or oral presentations. The information
provided in a capability estimate should be able to answ er most questions about a jurisdiction’s ability to
support a given course of action. Planners can u se capability estimates for both future and current
operational planning. At a minimum, planners should prepare separate capability estimates for personnel,
administration and finance, operati onal organizations (e.g., fire, law enforcement, EMS), logistics,
communications, equipment, and facilities. Each capab ility estimate compares the courses of action being
considered for a particular operation. They make  recommendations as to which course of action best
supports the operation. Capability estimates should also identify the criteria used to evaluate each area;
facts and assumptions that affect those areas; and the issues, differences, and risks associated with a
course of action. Figure 4.4  provides a suggested format for a capability estimate.
Figure 4.4: Suggested Capab ility Estimate Format
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Resource identification is particul arly important for supporting
children; individuals with disabilities, access, and functional
needs; and household pets and service animals . These
individuals will require a range of communication,
transportation, sheltering, human service, medical, and other resources throughout the life of an incident.

Examples include, but are not limited to, durable medical equipment, oxygen, paratransit vehicles, accessible shelters, personal assistance services, and sign language interpreters. Identifying these requirements and the resources for mee ting them ahead of time will help planners fully
support individuals with disabilities and ot hers with access and functional needs. When identifying resources, the needs
of children are often forgotten, including diapers, formula and food appropriate for all ages, portable cribs/
playpens and the capability to
supervise unaccompanied children.
Identify Information and Intelligence Needs
Another outcome from course of action development is a “list” of the information and intelligence needs
for each of the response participants. Planners shoul d identify the information and intelligence they will
need and their deadline(s) for receiving it to driv e decisions and trigger critical actions. These needs
eventually find their way into pl an information collection matrices.
When developing courses of action, the process should be periodically “frozen” so the planning team can:
• Identify progress made toward the end-state, including goals and objectives met and new needs or
demands
• Identify “single point failures” (i.e., tasks that, if  not completed, would cause the operation to fall
apart)
• Check for omissions or gaps
• Check for inconsistencies in organizational relationships
• Check for mismatches between the jurisdiction’s plan  and plans from other jurisdictions with which
they are interacting.
Step 5: Plan Preparati on, Review, and Approval
Write the Plan
This step turns the results of course of action devel opment into an EOP. The planning team develops a
rough draft of the basic plan, functional annexes, hazard-specific annexes, or other parts of the plan as
appropriate. The recorded results from Step 4 provide an  outline for the rough draft. As the planning team
works through successive drafts, the members add necessary tables, charts, and other graphics. The planning team prepares and circulates a final draft to obtain the comments of organizations that have
responsibilities for implementing the plan. (See Chapter 3 for more information on plan formats.)  Following these simple rules for writing plans and procedures will help ensure that readers and users understand their content:
• Keep the language simple and clear by writing in  plain English.

Summarize important information
with checklists and visual aids, such as maps and flowcharts.
• Avoid using jargon and minimize the use of acronyms.
• Use short sentences and the active voice. Qualifie rs and vague wording onl y add to confusion.
• Provide enough detail to convey an easily understood plan that is actionable. The amount of detail a
plan should provide depends on the target audience and the amount of certainty about the situation.
4-16
4. The Planning Process
• Format the plan and present its contents so that its readers can quickly find solutions and options.
Focus on providing mission guidance and not on discussing policy and regulations. Plans should
provide guidance for carrying out common tasks, as well as enough insight into intent and vision so that responders can handle unexpected events. Ho wever, when writing a plan, “stay out of the
weeds.” Procedural documents (e.g., SOPs /SOGs) should provide the fine details.
• Ensure accessibility by developing tool s and documents (e.g., print, electronic, video) so they can be
easily converted to alternate formats.
Review the Plan
Planners should check the written plan for its confor mity to applicable regulatory requirements and the
standards of Federal or state agencies, as appropriate , and for its usefulness in practice. Planners should
consult the next level of government about its plan review cycle. Reviews of plans allow other agencies
with emergency or homeland security responsibilities to suggest improvements to a plan on the basis of
their accumulated experience. For example, states may review local plans, and, upon request, FEMA
regional offices may assist states in the review of EO Ps. Hazard-specific Federal programs, such as the
Radiological Emergency Preparedness Program, require periodic review of certain sections of the all-
hazards plan and may require review of associated SOPs/SOGs.
Commonly used criteria can help decision makers de termine the effectiveness and efficiency of plans.
These measures include adequacy, feasibility, and acceptability. Decision makers directly involved in planning can employ these criteria, along with their understanding of plan requirements, not only to determine a plan’s effectiveness and efficiency but al so to assess risks and define costs. Some types of
analysis, such as a determination of acceptability, are largely intuitive.

In this case, decision makers apply
their experience, judgment, intuition, situational aw areness, and discretion. Other analyses, such as a
determination of feasibility, should be rigorous and standardized to minimize subjectivity and preclude
oversights.
• Adequacy . A plan is adequate if the scope and concept of planned operations identify and address
critical tasks effectively; the plan can accomplish the assigned mission while complying with
guidance; and the plan’s assumptions are valid, reasonable, and comply with guidance.
• Feasibility . A plan is feasible if the organization can accomplish the assigned mission and critical
tasks by using available resources within the time contemplated by the plan. The organization
allocates available resources to tasks and tracks th e resources by status (e.g., assigned, out of service).
Available resources include internal assets and tho se available through mutual aid or through existing
state, regional, or Federal assistance agreements.
• Acceptability . A plan is acceptable if it meets the requirements driven by a threat or incident, meets
decision maker and public cost and time limitations, a nd is consistent with the law. The plan can be
justified in terms of the cost of resources and if its scale is proportional to mission requirements.
Planners use both acceptability and feasibility tests to ensure that the mission can be accomplished
with available resources, without incurring excessive  risk regarding personnel,  equipment, material,
or time. They also verify that risk management procedures have identified, assessed, and applied control measures to mitigate operational risk (i.e ., the risk associated with achieving operational
objectives).
• Completeness . A plan is complete if it:
– Incorporates all tasks to be accomplished
– Includes all required capabilities
  4-17
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
4-18
– Integrates the needs of the general population, children of all ages, individuals with disabilities
and others with access and functional needs, im migrants, individuals with limited English
proficiency, and diverse racial and ethnic populations
– Provides a complete picture of the sequence a nd scope of the planned response operation (i.e.,
what should happen, when, and at whose direction)
– Makes time estimates for achieving objectives
– Identifies success criteria and a desired end-state.
• Compliance .

The plan should comply with guidance and doctrine to the maximum extent possible,
because these provide a baseline that facilitates both planning and execution.
 When using these five criteria, planners should ask the following questions:
• Did an action, a process, a decision, or the operationa l timing identified in the plan make the situation
worse or better?
• Were new alternate courses of action identified?
• Were the requirements of childre n, individuals with disabilities, others with access and functional
needs, immigrants, individuals with limited Eng lish proficiency, and diverse racial and ethnic
populations fully addressed and integrated into all appropriate aspects of the plan?
• What aspects of the action, process, decision, or ope rational timing make it something to keep in the
plan?
• What aspects of the action, process, decision, or operational timing make it something to avoid or
remove from the plan?
• What specific changes to plans and procedures, pe rsonnel, organizational structures, leadership or
management processes, facilities, or equi pment can improve ope rational performance?
Additionally, when reviewing the plan, a jurisdiction does not have to provide all of the resources needed
to meet a capability requirement established during the planning effort. However, the plan should explain
where the jurisdiction will obtain the resources to su pport those required capabilities. For example, many
jurisdictions do not have the bomb s quads or urban search and rescue  teams required to meet certain
capabilities. Neighboring jurisdictions can provide those resources (or capability elements) through
MAAs, MOAs, MOUs, regional compacts, or some other formal request process.
When conducting this review, the checklist in Appendix C will provide a useful benchmark to ensure all
planning elements are addressed. In particular, those el ements related to planning for children, individuals
with access and functional needs, and those with hous ehold pets and service animals are critical to each
component of the planning process.

When planning for these groups, consider the following questions,
while being mindful of specific concerns for immigran t, racial/ethnic communities, and individuals with
limited English proficiency:

– Does the plan recommend providing controlled areas (indoor or outdoor) for exercising dogs?
– Does the plan provide for household pe t waste and dead animal disposal?
– Does the plan provide for the reunion of  rescued animals with their owners?
– Does the plan include mechanisms or processe s to address the long-term care, permanent
relocation, or disposal of unclaimed household pets?
• Public Information and Outreach
– Does the plan provide mechanisms for continuall y updating public statements on shelter capacity
and availability as people/animals are coming to shelters?
– Does the plan provide for a public education program?
9 According to FEMA Disaster Assistance Policy 9523.19,

househol d pets do not include reptiles (except turtles), amphibians, fis h,
insects/arachnids, farm animals  (including horses), and animals  kept for racing purposes.

4. The Planning Process
– Does the plan provide for the coordination of household pet evacuation and sheltering
information with the jurisdiction’s public info rmation officer or Joint Information Center?
– Does the plan provide for communication of public information regarding shelter-in-place
accommodation of household pets, if available?
• Record Keeping
– Does the plan define the methods of pre- and post-declaration funding for the jurisdiction’s
household pet and service animal preparedness and emergency response program?
– Does the plan describe how to captu re eligible costs for reimbursement by the Public Assistance
Program as defined in Disaster Assistance Policy (DAP) 9523.19, Eligible Costs Related to Pet
Evacuations and Sheltering?
– Does the plan describe how to cap ture eligible donations for volunteer labor and resources as
defined in DAP 9525.2, Donated Resources?
– Does the plan describe how to cap ture eligible donations for mu tual aid resources as defined in
DAP 9523.6, Mutual Aid Agreements for Public Assistance and Fire Management Assistance?
Similar checklists can be developed as appropriate by  the jurisdiction to address other critical population
sectors, including populations with diverse languages and culture, populat ions with economic challenges,
populations that depend on public tran sportation, and nonresident visitors.
Approve and Disseminate the Plan
Once the plan has been validated, th e planner should present the plan to the appropriate elected officials
and obtain official promulgation of the plan. The promulgation process should be based in a specific
statute, law, or ordinance. Obtaining the senior official’s approval through a formal promulgation documentation process is vital to gaining the widest ac ceptance possible for the plan. It is also important
to establish the authority required for changes and modifications to the plan.

Once the senior official grants approval, the planner s hould arrange to distribute the plan and maintain a
record of the people and organizati ons that received a copy (or copies)  of the plan. “Sunshine” laws may
require that a copy of the plan be posted on the juri sdiction’s website or be placed in some other public
accessible location. The plan should be available in  alternate formats, upon request, to maintain
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.
Step 6: Plan Implementation and Maintenance
Training
After developing a plan, it must be disseminated and managers must be require d to train their personnel
so they have the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to perform the tasks identified in the plan.
Personnel should also be trained on the organization-specific procedures necessary to support those plan
tasks.
Exercise the Plan
Evaluating the effectiveness of plans involves a combin ation of training events, exercises, and real-world
incidents to determine whether the goals, objectives, decisions, actions, and timing outlined in the plan
led to a successful response. In this way, homeland security and other emergency preparedness exercise
programs become an integral part of the planning proc ess. Similarly, planners need to be aware of lessons
and practices from other communities. The Less ons Learned Information Sharing website
  4-25
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
4-26   (http://www.llis.dhs.gov) provides an excellent forum for evaluating concepts identif ied in a jurisdiction’s
plan against the experiences of others.
A remedial action process  can help a planning team identify,
illuminate, and correct problems with the jurisdiction’s EOP. This
process captures information from exercises, post-disaster critiques, self-assessments, audits, administrative reviews, or lessons-learned processes that may indicate that deficiencies exist. Members of the planning team should reconvene to discuss the problem and to
consider and assign responsibility for generating remedies across all
mission areas. Remedial actions may involve revising planning assumptions and operational concepts, changing organizational tasks,
or modifying organizational implementing instructions (i.e., the SOPs/SOGs). Remedial actions may also involve providing refresher
training for an organization’s personnel.

“Living” Plans
Plans must not be placed on a shelf to collect dust!
 Whenever possible, training and exercise must be conducted for each plan to ensure that current
and new personnel are familiar
with the priorities, goals, objectives and courses of action.
Plan maintenance is also critical
to the continue d utility of the
plans an organization has developed. A number of
operations have had setbacks
due to old information, ineffective procedures, incorrect role
assignments, and outdated laws.
Further, the priorities for a jurisdiction may change over time as the makeup of the included
communities change, as
resources expand or contract, and as capabilities evolve.
Routinely Review Your Plans!
The final component of a remedial action process is a mechanism for tracking and following up on the assigned actions. As appropriate, significant issues and problems identified through a remedial action
process and/or the annual review should provide the information
needed to allow the planning team to make the necessary revision(s)
to the plan.
Review, Revise, and Maintain the Plan
This step closes the loop in the pl anning process. It focuses on adding
the information gained by exercising the plan to the research collected
in Step 2 and starting the planning cycle over again. Remember,
planning is a continuous process that does not stop when the plan is published. Plans should evolve as lessons are learned, new information and insights are obtained, and priorities are updated.
Planning teams should establish a process for review ing and revising the plan. Reviews should be a
recurring activity. Some jurisdictions have found it us eful to review and revise portions of their EOPs
every month. Many accomplish their reviews on an annua l basis. In no case should any part of the plan go
for more than two years without being reviewed and revised.

Teams should also  consider reviewing and
updating the plan after the following events:
• A major incident
• A change in operational resources (e.g., policy, personnel, organizational structures, management
processes, facilities, equipment)
• A formal update of planning guidance or standards
• A change in elected officials
• Each activation
• Major exercises
• A change in the jurisdiction’s demogr aphics or hazard or threat profile
• A change in the acceptability of various risks
• The enactment of new or amended laws or ordinances.

circumstances of the emergency an d the legal obligation to undertake advance planning and prepare to
meet the disability-related needs of individuals w ho have disabilities as defined by the Americans with
Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, P.L. 110-325, and those associated with them.
Access and functional needs may include modifications to programs, policies, procedures, architecture, equipment, services, supplies, and communication methods. Examples of “access and functional needs”
services may include a reasonable modification of a policy, practice, or procedure or the provision of auxiliary aids and services to achieve effectiv e communication, including but not limited to:
• An exception for service animals in an emerge ncy shelter where there is a no-pets policy
• The provision of way-finding assistance to someone who is blind to orient to new surroundings
• The transferring and provision of toileting assistan ce to an individual with a mobility disability
• The provision of an interpreter to someone who is deaf and seeks to fill out paperwork for public benefits.
American Red Cross
A nongovernmental humanitarian organization led by  volunteers that provides relief to victims of
disasters and helps people prevent, prepare for, res pond to, and recover from emergencies. The American
Red Cross accomplishes this through services that ar e consistent with its Congressional Charter and the
Principles of the International Red Cross Movement.
Attack
A hostile action taken against the Unite d States by foreign forces or terrorists, resulting in the destruction
of or damage to military targets, injury or death to the civilian population, or damage to or destruction of
public and private property.
Capabilities-based Planning
Planning, under uncertainty, to provide capabilities suita ble for a wide range of threats and hazards while
working within an economic framework that necessi tates prioritization and choice.

Capabilities-based
planning addresses uncertainty by analyzing a wide  range of scenarios to identify required capabilities.
Checklist
Written (or computerized) enumeration of actions to be  taken by an individual or organization meant to
aid memory rather than provide detailed instruction.
Citizen Corps
A community-based program, administered by FEMA, which includes Citizen Corps councils and other
programs that bring government and nongovernmental en tities together to conduct all-hazards emergency
preparedness and operations. Through its network of st ate, territorial, tribal and local councils, Citizen
Corps increases community preparedness and respon se capabilities through collaborative planning, public
education, outreach, training, and volunteer service. Additionally, programs like the Community
Emergency Response Team Program train members of th e public in basic disaster response skills, such as
fire safety, light search and rescue, team organization, and disaster medical operations.
B-2
Appendix B: List of Acronyms and Glossary
Community
Community has more than one definition. Each use depends on the context:
• A political or geographical entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce laws and ordinances for
the area under its jurisdiction. In most cases, the comm unity is an incorporated town, city, township,
village, or unincorporated area of a county. Howeve r, each state defines its own political subdivisions
and forms of government.
• A group of individuals (community of interest) who ha ve a religion, a lifestyle, activity interests, an
interest in volunteer organiza tions, or other characteristics in common. These communities may
belong to more than one geographic commun ity.

Examples include: faith-based and social
organizations; nongovernmental a nd volunteer organizations; private service providers; critical
infrastructure operators; and local and regional corporations.
Consequence
An effect of an incident or occurrence.
Dam
A barrier built across a watercourse for the purpose of impounding, controlling, or diverting the flow of
water.
Damage Assessment
The process used to appraise or determine the number of injuries and deaths, damage to public and private
property, and status of key facilities and services (e.g., hospitals and other health care facilities, fire and police stations, communications networks, water and sanitation systems, utilities, transportation
networks) resulting from a human-caused or natural disaster.
Disability
According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, the term “individual with a disability” refers to “a
person who has a physical or mental impairment that s ubstantially limits one or more major life activities,
a person who has a history or record of such an im pairment, or a person who is regarded by others as
having such an impairment.” The term “disability” h as the same meaning as that  used in the Americans
with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, P.L. 1 10-325, as incorporated into the Americans with
Disabilities Act. See http://www.ada.gov/pubs/ada.htm for the definition and specific changes to the text
of the Americans with Disabilities Act. State laws and local ordina nces may also include individuals
outside the Federal definition.
Disaster
An occurrence of a natural catastrophe, technological acci dent, or human-caused incident that has resulted
in severe property damage, deaths, and/or multiple injuri es. As used in this Guide, a “large-scale disaster”
is one that exceeds the response cap ability of the local jurisdiction and requires state, and potentially
Federal, involvement. As used in the Robert T.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act
(Stafford Act), a “major disaster” is “any natural catastrophe [...] or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood,
or explosion, in any part of the United States, whic h in the determination of the President causes damage
of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant ma jor disaster assistance under [the] Act to supplement
the efforts and available resources of states, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in
alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering cau sed thereby” (Stafford Act, Sec. 102(2), 42 U.S.C.
5122(2)).
  B-3
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Earthquake
The sudden motion or trembling of the ground produced by abrupt displacement of rock masses, usually
within the upper 10 to 20 miles of the earth’s surface.
Emergency
Any incident, whether natural or human-caused, that re quires responsive action to protect life or property.
Under the Stafford Act, an emergency “means any occasi on or instance for which, in the determination of
the President, Federal assistance is needed to supplement state and local efforts and capabilities to save
lives and to protect property and public health and safet y, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe
in any part of the United States” (Stafford Act, Sec. 102(1), 42 U.S.C. 5122(1)).
Emergency Assistance
According to the National Response Framework, emergency assistance is “[a]ssistance required by
individuals, families, and their communities to ensure that immediate needs beyond the scope of the traditional ‘mass care’ services provided at the local level are addressed.

These services include: support to evacuations (including registration and tracking of evacuees); reunification of families; provision of aid
and services to special needs populations; evacuati on, sheltering, and other emergency services for
household pets and services animals; support to specialized shelters; support to medical shelters; nonconventional shelter management; coordination of donated good s and services; and coordination of
voluntary agency assistance.”
Emergency Medical Services
Services, including personnel, fac ilities, and equipment, required to ensure proper medical care for the
sick and injured from the time of injury to th e time of final disposition (which includes medical
disposition within a hospital, temporary medical facili ty, or special care facility; release from the site; or
being declared dead). Further, emergency medi cal services specifically includes those services
immediately required to ensure proper medical care a nd specialized treatment for patients in a hospital
and coordination of related hospital services.
Emergency Operations Center
The physical location at which the coordination of information and resources to support incident
management (on-scene operations) activities normally ta kes place. An Emergency Operations Center may
be a temporary facility or may be located in a more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at
a higher level of organization within a jurisdiction. Emergency Operations Centers may be organized by
major functional disciplines (e.g., fire, law enforcement,  medical services), by jurisdiction (e.g., Federal,
state, tribal, regional, city, county), or by some combination thereof.
Emergency Operations Plan
The ongoing plan maintained by various jurisdictional levels for responding to a wide variety of potential
hazards. It describes how people and property will be protected; details who is responsible for carrying
out specific actions; identifies the personnel, equipment,  facilities, supplies, and other resources available;
and outlines how all actions  will be coordinated.
Emergency Support Function
Used by the Federal Government and many stat e governments as the primary mechanism at the
operational level to organize and provide assistance. Emergency Suppor t Functions align categories of
resources and provide strategic objectives for their u se.

Emergency Support Functions use standardized
B-4
Appendix B: List of Acronyms and Glossary
resource management concepts such as typing, inve ntorying, and tracking to facilitate the dispatch,
deployment, and recovery of resources be fore, during, and after an incident.
Evacuation
The organized, phased, and supervised withdrawal, disp ersal, or removal of civilians from dangerous or
potentially dangerous areas, and their reception and care in safe areas.
• A spontaneous evacuation occurs when residents or citizens in the threatened areas observe an
incident or receive unofficial word of an actual or perceived threat and, without receiving instructions
to do so, elect to evacuate the area. Their movement , means, and direction of travel are unorganized
and unsupervised.
• A voluntary evacuation  is a warning to persons within a designated area that a threat to life and
property exists or is likely to exist in the immediate future. Individuals issued this type of warning or order are not required  to evacuate; however, it would be to their advantage to do so.
• A mandatory or directed evacuation  is a warning to persons within the designated area that an
imminent threat to life and property exists and individuals must  evacuate in accordance with the
instructions of local officials.
Evacuees
All persons removed or moving from areas threatened or struck by a disaster.
Federal Coordinating Officer
The official appointed by the President to execute Stafford Act authorities, including the commitment of
FEMA resources and mission assignments of other Federal departments or agencies. In all cases, the
Federal Coordinating Officer represents the FEMA Ad ministrator in the field to discharge all FEMA
responsibilities for the response and recovery efforts underway.

For Stafford Act incidents, the Federal
Coordinating Officer is the primary Federal representa tive with whom the State Coordinating Officer and
other response officials interface to determine the most  urgent needs and to set objectives for an effective
response in collaboration with the Unified Coordination Group.
Flood
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from
overflow of inland or tidal wate rs, unusual or rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters, or
mudslides/mudflows caused by accumulation of water.
Governor’s Authorized Representative
An individual empowered by a Governor to: (1) ex ecute all necessary documents for disaster assistance
on behalf of the state, including certification of ap plications for public assistance; (2) represent the
Governor of the impacted state in the Unified Coordination Group, when required; (3) coordinate and
supervise the state disaster assistance program to in clude serving as its grant administrator; and (4)
identify, in coordination with the State Coordinatin g Officer, the state’s critical information needs for
incorporation into a list of Essential Elements of Information.
Hazard
A natural, technological, or human-caused source or cause of harm or difficulty.
  B-5
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Hazardous Material
Any substance or material that, wh en involved in an accident and re leased in sufficient quantities, poses a
risk to people’s health, safety, and/or property . These substances and materials include explosives,
radioactive materials, flammable liquids or solids,  combustible liquids or solids, poisons, oxidizers,
toxins, and corrosive materials.
Household Pet
According to FEMA Disaster Assistance Policy 9253.19 , “[a] domesticated animal, such as a dog, cat,
bird, rabbit, rodent, or turtle, that  is traditionally kept in the home fo r pleasure rather than for commercial
purposes, can travel in commercial carriers, and be ho used in temporary facilities.

Household pets do not
include reptiles (except turtles), amphibians, fish, in sects/arachnids, farm animals (including horses), and
animals kept for racing purposes.” This definition is used by FEMA to determine assistance that FEMA
will reimburse and is the definition used in the produc tion of this Guide. Individual jurisdictions may
have different definitions based on other criteria.
Hurricane
A tropical cyclone, formed in the atmosphere over warm ocean areas, in which wind speeds reach 74
miles per hour or more and blow in a large spiral around a relatively calm center or eye. Circulation is
counter-clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere.
Incident
An occurrence or event—natural, technological, or human-caused—that requires a response to protect
life, property, or the environment (e.g., major disasters,  emergencies, terrorist attacks, terrorist threats,
civil unrest, wildland and urban fires, floods, hazardo us materials spills, nuclear accidents, aircraft
accidents, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical  storms, tsunamis, war-related disasters, public
health and medical emergencies, other occu rrences requiring an emergency response).
Incident Command System A standardized on-scene emergency management construc t specifically designed to provide an integrated
organizational structure that reflects the complexity and demands of single or multiple incidents, without
being hindered by jurisdictional boundaries. The In cident Command System is the combination of
facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications operating within a common
organizational structure and designed to aid in the management of resources during incidents. It is used
for all kinds of emergencies and is  applicable to small, as well as large and complex, incidents. The
Incident Command System is used by various juri sdictions and functional agencies, both public and
private, to organize field-level incident management operations.
Incident Management Assistance Team
A national-based or regional-based team composed of SMEs and incident management professionals,
usually composed of personnel from multiple Federal departments and agencies, which provide incident
management support during a major incident.
Joint Field Office
The primary Federal incident management field struct ure.

The Joint Field Office is a temporary Federal
facility that provides a central location for the coordination of Federal, state, territorial, tribal, and local
governments and private sector and nongovernmental  organizations with primary responsibility for
response and recovery. The Joint Field Office structur e is organized, staffed, and managed in a manner
consistent with National Incident Management System  principles and is led by the Unified Coordination

Group. Although the Joint Field Office uses an Incide nt Command System structure, the Joint Field
Office does not manage on-scene operations. Instead, the Joint Field Office focuses on providing support
to on-scene efforts and conducting broader support opera tions that may extend beyond the incident site.
Joint Information Center
A facility established to coordinate a ll incident-related public information activities. It is the central point
of contact for all news media. Public information o fficials from all participating agencies should co-locate
at the Joint Information Center.
Jurisdiction
Jurisdiction has more than one definition. Each use depends on the context:
• A range or sphere of authority. Public agencies have jurisdiction at an incident related to their legal
responsibilities and authority.

Jurisdictional authority at an incident can be political or geographical
(e.g., city, county, tribal, state, or Federal boundary lines) or functional (e.g., law enforcement, public health).
• A political subdivision (e.g., Federal, state, count y, parish, municipality) with the responsibility for
ensuring public safety, health, and welfare within its legal authorities and geographic boundaries.
Likelihood
Estimate of the potential for an incident’s occurrence.
Limited English Proficiency
Persons who do not speak English as their primary la nguage and who have a limited ability to read, speak,
write, or understand English.
Mass Care
The actions that are taken to protect evacuees  and other disaster victims from the effects of the disaster.
Activities include mass evacuation, mass sheltering, mass feeding, access and functional needs support,
and household pet and service animal coordination.
Mitigation
Activities providing a critical foundation in the effort to reduce the loss of life and property from natural
and/or human-caused disasters by avoiding or lessening the impact of a disaster and providing value to
the public by creating safer communities. Mitigation seeks to fix the cycle of disaster damage, reconstruction, and repeated damage. These activities or actions, in most cases, will have a long-term
sustained effect.
National Incident Management System
A set of principles that provides a systematic, proactive approach guiding government agencies at all
levels, nongovernmental organizations , and the private sector to work seamlessly to prevent, protect
against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the effects of incidents, regardless of cause, size, location, or complexity, in order to reduce the loss of life or property and harm to the environment.
National Response Framework
This document establishes a comprehens ive, national, all-hazards approach  to domestic incident response.
It serves as a guide to enable responders at all le vels of government and beyond to provide a unified
  B-7
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
national response to a disaster. It defines the key prin ciples, roles, and structures that organize the way
U.S. jurisdictions plan and respond.
Nongovernmental Organization
An entity with an association that is based on the interest s of its members, individuals, or institutions.

It is
not created by a government, but it may work cooperativ ely with government. Such organizations serve a
public purpose and are not for private benefit. Examples of nongovernmental organizations include faith-
based charity organizations and the American Red Cross.
Planning Assumptions
Parameters that are expected and used as a context, basis, or requirement for the development of response
and recovery plans, processes, and procedures. If a planning assumption is not valid for a specific
incident’s circumstances, the plan may not be ade quate to ensure response success. Alternative methods
may be needed. For example, if a decontamination capability is based on the planning assumption that the facility is not within the zone of release, this assumption must be verified at the beginning of the response.
Preparedness
Actions that involve a combination of planning, reso urces, training, exercising, and organizing to build,
sustain, and improve operational capabilities. Prepar edness is the process of identifying the personnel,
training, and equipment needed for a wide range of potential incidents, and developing jurisdiction-
specific plans for delivering capabiliti es when needed for an incident.
Prevention
Actions to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring. Prevention involves
actions to protect lives and property. It involves appl ying intelligence and other information to a range of
activities that may include such countermeasures as  deterrence operations; heightened inspections;
improved surveillance and security operations; investig ations to determine the full nature and source of
the threat; public health and agri cultural surveillance and testing processes; immunizations, isolation, or
quarantine; and, as appropriate, specific law enfo rcement operations aimed at deterring, preempting,
interdicting, or disrupting illegal ac tivity and apprehending potential perp etrators and bringing them to
justice.
Protected Group
A group of people qualified for special protection by a law, policy, or similar authority. For example,
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects against discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or
national origin.
Protection
Actions to reduce or eliminate a threat to people, property, and the environment.

Primarily focused on
adversarial incidents, the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources is vital to local
jurisdictions, national security, pub lic health and safety, and economic vitality. Protective actions may
occur before, during, or after an incident and prevent, minimize, or contain the impact of an incident.
Recovery
The development, coordination, and execution of service and site restoration plans; the reconstitution of
government operations and services; individual, pr ivate sector, nongovernmental, and public assistance
programs to provide housing and to promote restor ation; long-term care and treatment of affected
persons; additional measures for social, political, envir onmental, and economic restoration; evaluation of
B-8
Appendix B: List of Acronyms and Glossary
the incident to identify lessons learned; post-incident  reporting; and development of initiatives to mitigate
the effects of future incidents.
Resource Management
A system for identifying available resources at all juri sdictional levels to enable timely, efficient, and
unimpeded access to resources needed to prepare for, respond to, or recover from an incident. Resource
management under the National Incident Manageme nt System includes mutual aid and assistance
agreements; the use of special Federal, state, territo rial, tribal, and local teams; and resource mobilization
protocols.
Response
Immediate actions to save and sustain lives, protect property and the environment, and meet basic human
needs.

Response also includes the execution of plans and actions to support short-term recovery.
Risk
The potential for an unwanted outcome resulting from an  incident or occurrence, as determined by its
likelihood and the associated consequences.
Risk Analysis
A systematic examination of the co mponents and characteristics of risk.
Risk Assessment A product or process that collects information and assi gns values to risks for the purpose of informing
priorities, developing or comparing courses of action, and informing decision making.
Risk Identification The process of finding, recognizing, and describing potential risks.
Risk Management The process of identifying, analyzing, assessing, and communicating risk and accepting, avoiding,
transferring, or controlling it to an acceptable level at an acceptable cost.
Scenario
Hypothetical situation composed of a hazard, an en tity impacted by that hazard, and associated conditions
including consequences when appropriate.
Scenario-based Planning
A planning approach that uses a hazard vulnerab ility assessment to assess the hazard’s impact on an
organization on the basis of various threats that th e organization could encounter. These threats (e.g.,
hurricane, terrorist attack) become the basis of the scenario.

Appendix C:  Emergency
Operations Plan Development
Guide
This appendix provides a pu ll-out guide that applies the planning process described in Chapter 4 and
provides content guidance for various elements of an emergency operations plan (EOP).

It includes a list
of key planning elements that should be included in the basic plan and its annexes. It is not all-inclusive
or intended to prescribe any particular plan format, and it is not meant to indicate that all items are
appropriate to every level of government. Statutes may assign authority to perform various functions. A
brief reference should be made to these statutes in the plan where applicable.
Steps in the Planning Process
Step 1: Form a Collaborative Planning Team. Planners must ensure that  operational planning not only
involves the jurisdiction’s entire emergency manageme nt and homeland security team, but also actively
engages the whole community in the planning pr ocess. Planning must also be community-based,
integrating the needs of the entire community. This includes addressing the critical planning requirements
of children, individuals with disabilities, others w ith access and functional needs, and individuals with
limited English proficiency. Using a team or group a pproach helps organizations define their perception
of the role they will play during an operation. Invol vement of the private sector is especially critical in
this process. Initially, the team should be small, cons isting of planners from the organizations that usually
participate in emergency or homeland security operati ons. They form the core for all planning efforts.
 Disasters begin and end locally. When the response is ove r, it is the local community that has to live with
the decisions made during the incident. Therefore, communities should have a say in how a disaster response occurs. They should also shoulder respons ibility for building their community’s resilience and
enhancing its recovery before, during, and after a disaster. The community can bring capabilities and
resources to an incident that may not exist in th e volume needed or at all within the traditional
government structure. Engaging the whole community as part of the planning team is critical for
resilience. Figure 4.2  provides methods for engaging the community in the planning process.
Step 2: Understand the Situation. Planners should begin the problem-solving process by conducting
research and analysis on the jurisdiction’s threats, hazards, and resources. Giving consideration to the
potential risks a jurisdiction may face brings specificity to the planning process. If risks are viewed as
problems and operational plans are the solution, then h azard and threat identification and analysis are key
steps in the planning process.

The first step of research focuses on gathering inform ation about the jurisdiction’s planning framework,
potential risks, resource base, demographics, household pet and service animal population, and geographic characteristics that could affect emergency operations. There are many existing resources available to support planners in this step, incl uding threat assessments, mitigation plans, local
organizations (e.g., businesses, nongovernmental entities, utilities), Federal and state analyses that include
data about historical incidents, a nd registries for population demographics.
  C-1
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
The second step of the threat and hazard identification process is to organize the information into a format
that is usable by the planning team. One effective me thod for organizing hazard or threat information is to
use a matrix based on dimensions used during the ri sk analysis process, incl uding the (1) probability or
frequency of occurrence; (2) magnitude (i.e., the physical  force associated with the hazard or threat); (3)
intensity/severity (i.e., the impact or damage expect ed); (4) time available to warn; (5) location of the
incident (i.e., an area of interest or a specific or indeterminate site or facility); (6) potential size of the affected area; (7) speed of onset (i.e., how fast the hazard or threat can impact the public); (8) duration
(i.e., how long the hazard or threat will be active); and (9) cascading effects.
The risk assessment is the basis for EOP development. The assessment helps a planning team decide what hazards or threats merit special attention, what actions  must be planned for, and what resources are likely
to be needed. In order to set planning priorities, the planning team must consider the frequency of the hazard or threat and the likelihood or potential severity of its consequences in order to develop a single
indicator of the risk to the jurisdiction. This can  be done using a mathematical approach, qualitative
ratings, or index numbers.

While a mathematical approach is possible, it may be easier to manipulate
qualitative ratings (e.g., high, medium, low) or index numbers (e.g., reducing quantitative information to a
1-to-3, 1-to-5, or 1-to-10 scale based on defined thres holds) for different categories of information used in
the ranking scheme. Some approaches involve the c onsideration of only two categories—frequency and
consequences—and treat them as equally important. In other approaches, potential consequences receive
more weight than frequency. While  it is important to have a sense of the magnitude involved (i.e.,
whether in regard to the single indicator used to  rank hazards or to estimate the numbers of people
affected), these indicators are static. Some hazards or threats may pose a limited risk to the community; therefore, additional analysis is not necessary.
Step 3: Determine Goals and Objectives. Using information
from the hazard profile developed as part of the analysis process,
the planning team should think about how the hazard or threat would evolve in the jurisdiction and what defines a successful operation.

During this process, the planning team identifies
requirements that determine actions and resources, including the
following: Example: Relationships among the
Mission, Operational Priorities,
Goals, and Objectives
Plan Mission: Effectively coordinate
and direct available resources to
protect the public and property from hazards or threats.
 Operational Priority:  Protect the
public from hurricane weather and storm surge.
Goal:  Complete evac uation before
arrival of tropical storm winds.
Desired result: all self- and assisted
evacuees are safely outside of the
expected impact area prior to impact.
Objective: Complete tourist
evacuation 72 hours before arrival of
tropical storm winds.
Desired result: tourist segment of
public protected prior to hazard onset,
allowing resources to be redirected to accomplishing other objectives in supportof this goal or other g oals.• Agent requirements are caused by the nature of the hazard or
threat.
• Response requirements are caused by actions taken in response to an incident-generated problem.
• Constraint/restraint demands are caused by things planners must do, are prohibited from doing,
and/or are not able to do.
Once the planning team identifies requirements, they restate them as priorities, goals, and objectives. Priorities  indicate a desired
end-state for the operation. A critical source for these priorities is the vision and desired end-state co mmunicated by senior officials.
Goals  are broad, general statements that indicate the intended
methods for achieving the mission and priorities, specifying desired results. Objectives  are more specific and identifiable
actions carried out during the operation. Clear definition of goals and objectives enables unity of effort and consistency of purpose
C-2
Appendix C: Emergency Operations Plan Development Guide
among the multiple groups and activities involved in executing the plan.
Step 4: Plan Development. First, develop and analyze courses of action. This is a process of generating
and comparing possible solutions for achieving the goals and objectives identified in Step 3. Use a
process that combines aspects of scenario-based, functi onal, and capabilities-based planning. Depict how
the operation unfolds by using a visual process that  shows relationships among the incident’s actions,
decision points, and participant activities that allow th e planner to anticipate challenges.

Typically, such a
process follows these steps:
• Establish the timeline . Planners typically use the speed of an incident’s onset to establish the
timeline. Placement of decision points and res ponse actions on the timeline depicts how soon the
different entities enter the plan.
• Depict the scenario . Planners use the scenario information de veloped in Step 3 and place the incident
information on the timeline.
• Identify and depict decision points . Decision points indicate the place in time, as incidents unfold,
when leaders anticipate making decisions about a course of action. They indicate where and when
decisions are required to provide the best chance of achieving an intermediate objective or response
goal (i.e., the desired end-state). They also help pl anners determine how much time is available or
needed to complete a sequence of actions.
• Identify and depict operational tasks . For each operational task depicted, some basic information is
needed.
– What is the action?
– Who is responsible for the action?
– When should the action take place?
– How long should the action take and how much time is actually available?
– What has to happen before?
– What happens after?
– What resources does the person/entity performing the action need?
• Select courses of action. Planners must compare the costs and benefits of each proposed course of
action against the mission, goals, and objectives. Based on this comparison, planners then select the
preferred courses of action to move forward in th e planning process. To the extent possible and
appropriate, senior officials should approve course of action decisions during plan development.
• Identify resources . Initially, the planning team identifies resources needed to accomplish operational
tasks in an unlimited manner. Once the planning team identifies all the requirements, they begin
matching available resources to requirements. The EOP should account for unsolvable resource
shortfalls so they are not just “assumed away.”
• Identify information needs . Planners identify a “list” of the information needs for each of the
response participants, including the time they need it, to drive decisions and trigger critical actions.
• Assess progress .

This process should be periodically “frozen” so the planning team can:
– Identify progress made toward the end-state
– Identify goals and objectives met and new needs or demands
– Identify “single point failures” (i.e., tasks that , if not completed, would cause the operation
to fall apart)
  C-3
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
– Check for omissions or gaps
– Check for inconsistencies in organizational relationships.
The planning team should work through this pro cess by using tools that help members visualize
operational flow, such as a white board, “sticky note” chart, or some type of project management or
planning software.
Step 5: Plan Preparation, Review, and Approval. This step turns the results of the course of action
development performed in Step 4 into an EOP. Th e planning team develops a rough draft of the basic
plan or annexes. As the planning team works throu gh successive drafts, they add necessary tables, charts,
and other graphics. The team prepares a final draft a nd circulates it for comment to organizations that
have responsibilities for implementing the plan. The writte n plan should be checked for its conformity to
applicable regulatory requirements and the standards of  Federal or state agencies (as appropriate) and for
its usefulness in practice. Once validated, the planning team presents the plan to the appropriate officials for signature and promulgation. The promulgation process should be based on specific statute, law, or
ordinance. Once approved, the planner should arrange to distribute the plan to stakeholders who have
roles in implementing the plan. Step 6: Plan Implementation and Maintenance. Evaluating the effectiveness of plans involves a
combination of training events, exercises, and real -world incidents to determine whether the goals,
objectives, decisions, actions, and timing outlined in  the plan led to a successful response. Commonly
used criteria can help decision makers determine the effectiveness and efficiency of plans. These
measures include adequacy, feasibility, acceptability, completeness, and compliance with guidance or
doctrine.

When evaluating the plan, planners should ask the following questions:
• Did an action, process, decision, or the operational timing identified in the plan make the situation
worse or better?
• Were new alternate courses of action identified?
• Were the requirements of childre n, individuals with disabilities, and others with access and functional
needs fully addressed and integrated into  all appropriate aspects of the plan?
• What aspects of the action, process, decision, or ope rational timing make it something to keep in the
plan?
• What aspects of the action, process, decision, or operational timing make it something to avoid or
remove from the plan?
• What specific changes to plans and procedures, pe rsonnel, organizational structures, leadership or
management processes, facilities, or equi pment can improve ope rational performance?
 Planning teams should establish a recurring process for reviewing and revising the plan. For example, each component of the plan is reviewed and revised at a minimum of once every two years.

Teams should also consider reviewing and updating the plan after the following events:
• A change in operational resources
• A formal update of planning guidance or standards
• A change in elected or appointed officials
• A plan activation or major exercise
C-4
Appendix C: Emergency Operations Plan Development Guide
• A change in the jurisdiction’s demogr aphics or hazard or threat profile
• The enactment of new or amended laws or ordinances.

each Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to develop a Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan on this topic. Some states have laws  requiring the local emergency management agency to
incorporate the LEPC’s plan into the emergency management agency’s planning and preparedness
activities. Specific planning criteria established by a State Emergency Response Commission must be
reviewed and addressed in order to develop the LEPC plan.
• For LEPCs that complete a stand-alone plan, describe how the jurisdiction coordinates that plan with
the EOP.
• For LEPC plans that are part of the EOP, describe how the planning team used and adhered to the
