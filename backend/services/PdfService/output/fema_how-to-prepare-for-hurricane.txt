  |   2How to Prepare for a Hurricane
Hurricanes are massive storm systems that form over ocean water and often move toward land.
Threats from hurricanes include high winds, heavy rainfall, storm surge, coastal and inland flooding, rip currents, and tornadoes. The heavy winds of hurricanes can cause damage or destroy homes, buildings, and roads, as well as cause power, water, and gas outages. These effects can injure or kill people, disrupt transportation, and pollute drinking water. Hurricanes cause deaths and injuries primarily from drowning, wind, and wind-borne debris. The impact from hurricanes can extend from the coast to several hundred miles inland. To find your risk, visit FEMA’s “ Know Your Risk Map. ”
Be better prepared for this hurricane season, and learn more at ready.gov/prepare .

WATCHES AND WARNINGS
The National Weather Service (NWS) , part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA), issues alerts when weather conditions make hurricanes more likely. Know the terms used to
describe changing hurricane conditions and be prepared to take appropriate action.
ADVISORYTropical Storm or Hurricane Advisory —The NWS issues an Advisory when it
expects conditions to cause significant inconveniences that may be hazardous.
If caution is used, these situations should not be life-threatening.
WATCHTro
pical Storm or Hurricane Watch —The NWS issues a Watch when a tropical storm
or hurricane is possible within 48 hours. Tune in to NOAA Weather Radio All Hazards, local radio, TV, or other news sources for more information. Monitor alerts, check your emergency supplies, and gather any items you may need if you lose power.
WARNINGTro
pical Storm or Hurricane Warning —The NWS issues a Warning when it expects
a tropical storm or hurricane within 36 hours. During a Warning, complete your storm preparations, and immediately leave the threatened area if directed to do so by local officials.

PLAN FOR EVACUATION
If the danger is significant, state or local government officials
m
ay issue an evacuation notice.

You can do the following to
be
 better prepared.
 Le
arn your community’s evacuation
plan and identify several posted
routes to leave the area.
•  Evacuation routes: Check with
your state’s Department of Transportation or Office of Emergency Management website to find routes near you.
•  Emergency shelter location:
To find a shelter near you, download the FEMA app at   fema.gov/mobile-app .
Once you determine your evacuation route and shelter location, write them down on your Hurricane Preparedness Checklist , which is
located at the end of this guide.
Make a plan for your pet.
To lear
n more, go to
ready
.gov/animals .WHAT YOU NEED TO BE READY
•  Plan for your entire household
including children, people with disabilities and access and functional needs, and pets.
•  Keep your gas tank at least
half-full at all times. Maintain
basic emergency supplies (e.g.,
snacks, bottled water, first aid kit, flashlight, flares, jumper cables and other tools, a wool blanket, and a change of clothes) in your vehicle.
•  Pick an out-of-state contact
everyone can call to check-in and report their status.
•  Know where you will meet up
if you are separated and where you will stay.
•  Pack a “go bag” including items
you need to take with you if you evacuate. A “go bag” should be easy to carry and kept in a place where you can grab it quickly.

CREATE YOUR
F
AMILY EMERGENCY
COMMUNICATION PLAN
Your family may not be
together when a hurricane occurs, so it is important to know how to contact one another and how to get  back together.
Keep important numbers written
down in your wallet in case you cannot access the contact list in your phone. Landline and cellular phone systems are often overwhelmed following a disaster, so you may need to use text messages and social media. Designate an out-of-town contact who can help your household reconnect. Be sure to practice your plan with your family.

TAKE ACTION TO PROTECT YOUR PROPERTY
AGAINST W
IND AND WATER DAMAGE
Planning and preparing before a hurricane strikes can help you manage the impact of high winds and
floodwaters. Take the steps outlined below to keep you and your family safe while protecting your home and property. If you are a renter, talk with your landlord or property manager about the steps you can take together to protect yourself, your family, your home, and your property.
WIND
High winds: The best way to reduce the risk of damage to a structure from
hurricane winds is to reinforce or strengthen the building including doors,
windows, walls, and roofs. The best way to protect yourself is to consider either constructing a safe room that meets FEMA criteria or a storm shelter that meets ICC 500 criteria.
Wind-borne debris:  Bring loose, lightweight objects (e.g., patio furniture,
garbage cans, and bicycles) inside; anchor objects that would be unsafe to bring inside (e.g., gas grills and propane tanks); and trim or remove trees
close enough to fall on buildings.
FLOOD
There are steps that you or your
property owner can take now to make your home or business more flood resistant. Some improvements are simple and inexpensive; others require more of an investment.

As your budget allows, take these steps to protect your property from flood damage and manage your risks.
•  Keep gutters and drains free
of debris.
•  Install a water alarm and sump pumps with battery backup.•  Install “check valves” in sewer lines to prevent floodwater from backing up into your drains.
•  Stockpile emergency protective materials such as plywood, plastic sheeting, and sandbags.
•  Elevate the heating system (furnace), water heater, and electric panel if susceptible to flooding.
•  Waterproof the basement.
•  In areas with repetitive flooding, consider elevating the building.
For more resources about hurricane risk, visit FLOOD INSURANCE
Most property insurance policies do not cover flood losses, so you will need to purchase separate flood insurance
i
f your property is at risk for flooding. Talk to your insurance agent about buying flood insurance. Flood insurance
i
s available for homeowners, renters, and business owners through the National Flood Insurance Program in
participating communities. Keep in mind that a policy purchased today will take 30 days to go into effect, so act now!

DECIDING TO STAY OR GO
If authorities advise or order you to evacuate, grab your “go bag” and leave immediately . If you are not in
a mandatory evacuation zone, you may still decide to leave the area, you may need to move to higher
ground, or you may choose to stay in your home. If you decide to stay home, remember that even if the high winds and floodwaters do not reach your home, you may lose power and water, and you may not be able to leave your home for several days if the roads are impassable.
For more resources about hurricane risk, visit   |   7IF YOU ARE IN AN AREA WHERE AUTHORITIES ADVISE OR ORDER YOU TO EVACUATE :
TA
KE ACTION IMMEDIATELY TO EVACUATE!
Grab your “go bag” and leave immediately. Follow posted evacuation
routes and do not try to take shortcuts because they may be blocked.

Stick to designated evacuation routes. For localized information:
•  Evacuation routes: Check with your state’s Department of Transportation
or Office of Emergency Management website to find routes near you.
•  Emergency shelter location:  To find a shelter near you, check the
FEMA mobile app: fema.gov/mobile-app .
Don’t forget: Write down your evacuation route and shelter information on your Hurricane Preparedness Checklist .
IF YOU ARE IN AN AREA WITHOUT  AN EVACUATION NOTICE:
If you are in an area that is flooding (e.g., on the coast, on a floodplain, near a river, or on an island waterway), move to a location on higher ground before floodwaters reach you.
St ay indoors and away from
windows and glass doors. If you are in a temporary structure, safely move to a sturdy building and go to a windowless room on the lowest level that is not likely to flood.
Ne ver use a generator, gasoline-
powered equipment and tools, grill, camp stove, or charcoal burning device inside or in any partially enclosed area. Keep these devices outside and at least 20 feet from doors, windows, and vents.

POST-DISASTER
TIPS TO STAY SAFE
If you’ve evacuated the area,
wait for public officials to say it is safe before returning. Each year, a significant number of people are injured or killed while cleaning up after a hurricane. As you  begin cleanup, keep these safety tips in mind:
STAY SAFE
Do not wade in floodwaters, which can contain dangerous debris like broken
glass, metal, dead animals, sewage, gasoline, oil, and downed power lines.
Do not enter a building until it has been inspected for damage to the
electrical system, gas lines, septic systems, and water lines or wells.
Wear appropriate protective equipment such as gloves, safety glasses, rubber boots, and masks to protect you from debris and airborne particles, e.g., mold and dust.
Do not use electrical equipment  if it is wet or if you are standing in water.
Protect your pet following a hurricane.

To learn more, visit ready.gov/animals .
STAY HEALTHY
Throw out any food  including canned items that were not maintained at a
proper temperature or have been exposed to floodwaters. Do not eat food from a flooded garden. When in doubt, throw it out.
Avoid drinking tap water  until you know it is safe. If uncertain, boil or
purify it first.
Clean and disinfect everything  that got wet. Mud left from floodwater
can contain sewage, bacteria, and chemicals.

emergency supply of food and a communication plan can be of benefit no matter the hazard.
2  MYTH: My homeowners
insurance should cover everything if a hurricane  affects me.
  FACT: This is not always the
case. Check your insurance policy and consult your insurance agent.
  FACT: Standard homeowners
insurance does not cover flood  damage. 3  MYTH: In an emergency, only
first responders need to know what to do.
  FACT: Everyone needs to know
what to do before, during, and after a hurricane to protect themselves, their families, and their neighbors.
  FACT: First responders may not
reach you for hours or days after a hurricane strikes. Everyone needs to know what to do to stay safe.
4  MYTH:  I am prepared for any
emergency, including a hurricane, if I have an emergency kit packed.
  FACT: Emergency preparedness
requires more than a kit.
  FACT: Having a family
communication plan, signing up for alerts and warnings, and knowing what to do and how to evacuate are also important.
  FACT: Many emergencies
require knowledge of what to do to protect yourself.5  MYTH: It’s okay if I drive
through a small amount of
floodwater.
  FACT: As little as 12 inches of
water can float smaller SUVs and 18 inches of water can float larger vehicles such as full-size SUVs.
  FACT: The depth of the water is
not always obvious, and moving water has tremendous power.

Turn Around Don’t Drown
®
  FACT: Even a small amount of
water on a road may hide dangers such as undermined roads ready to collapse.
  MYTH: A person can safely wait
to evacuate until confirmation that a hurricane is in their area. 6
  FACT: Those who wait for actual
confirmation of a hurricane may be trapped by high winds, flooding, or traffic.
7  MYTH: If I tape my windows, it
will protect them from strong hurricane force winds.
  FACT: Taping windows can
create larger and deadlier shards of glass.
  FACT: Hurricane shutters or
impact-resistant windows are far more effective in protecting against breakage of windows.
