Wildfire Hazard Mitigation
Handbook for Public Facilities

Introduction
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) strives
continuously to improve the delivery of disaster assistance to State,
local, and tribal governments� One important goal of disaster assistance
is to reduce the vulnerability of communities to damage from future
disasters� This Wildfire Hazard Mitigation Handbook for Public Facilities
(Handbook) is intended to assist facility owners affected by wildfire
disasters by suggesting mitigation measures that can be taken to reduce
the vulnerability of damaged facilities to future wildfire incidents. The
measures described in this Handbook are applicable to the Public
Assistance (PA) Program and are intended to help Applicants for
assistance under the program identify options that can be implemented
during post-disaster repair and rebuilding to reduce the potential for
future damage �
FEMA provides assistance to State, local, and tribal governments under
the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency
Assistance Act (Stafford Act), 42 United States Code §§ 5121-5206,
as amended. Under the Stafford Act, FEMA is authorized to provide
resources necessary to reduce the loss of life and property caused by
emergencies and major disasters. FEMA works with Federal, State, local,
and tribal liaisons to carry out this mission through a comprehensive
emergency management program.
FEMA provides funding and technical assistance to State, local, and
tribal governments for a range of disaster preparedness and mitigation
activities. The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) grant program provides
funding to State, local, and tribal governments for mitigation planning
and implementation of cost-effective mitigation projects prior to a
disaster �
After the President declares a major disaster, FEMA incorporates
mitigation into recovery efforts through several mechanisms.

Under
Section 406 of the Stafford Act, FEMA provides funding for repair and
rebuilding of disaster-damaged public facilities and those of certain
private, non-profit entities through the PA Program. As part of the
PA Program, FEMA may provide funding for cost-effective mitigation
measures undertaken in the course of repairing or rebuilding damaged
facilities, sometimes referred to as “406 Mitigation.” Section 404
of the Stafford Act also authorizes FEMA to provide funding to State,
local, and tribal governments through the Hazard Mitigation Grant
Program (HMGP), sometimes referred to as “404 Mitigation,” for the
implementation of long-term mitigation measures �
iv IntroductionThis Handbook focuses on mitigation that FEMA funds under the PA
Program following Presidentially declared disasters in which assistance
for the restoration of disaster-damaged facilities is authorized. The
Handbook can also be useful for evaluating the mitigation options
that are available to planners when developing long-term mitigation
strategies or when considering measures to be funded under the
HMGP, PDM Program, or other grant programs, even though these other
programs are not described in the Handbook �
The Problem
The cost of response and recovery has escalated to unprecedented
levels in recent years from the increased frequency and severity
of disasters � Between 1999 and 2008, FEMA spent an average of
$2.8  billion per year responding to major disasters. Of that amount, an
average of $1 �2 billion was spent repairing or replacing public facilities,
which does not include response and recovery costs of other Federal
agencies; State, local, and tribal governments; and losses of individuals
and businesses� For more information, see www �fema�gov/government/
grant/pa/stat2�sht m�
The Solution
The most effective way to reduce excessive loss is through disaster
preparedness and mitigation � To best achieve this goal, FEMA
encourages the vigorous pursuit of the following objectives �
objective 1: Break the disaster-rebuild-disaster cycle. Until recently,
this cycle was the most common mode of disaster recovery. Repairing
substandard facilities to their pre-disaster condition does not protect
the community from future damage or reduce long-term costs.

The
community should work to break this cycle through effective planning,
identification of measures that can reduce the potential for future
damage, and adoption of appropriate codes and standards for
construction �
objective 2: Strengthen facilities so that they are able to withstand
natural hazards more effectively. Cost-effective upgrades that reduce
the probability of future damage to vulnerable facilities and that can be
incorporated during rebuilding should be considered whenever possible �
objective 3: Ensure that communities address natural hazards as part
of comprehensive planning � Comprehensive plans should include the
community’s significant natural hazards and the goals and actions that
reduce the community’s vulnerability to these hazards.
Introduction vThe r esult
Achieving these objectives will substantially enhance community
resilience and economic sustainability after a disaster, as shown in
Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves: An Independent Study to Assess
the Future Savings from Mitigation Activities , a study conducted by
the Multihazard Mitigation Council and funded by FEMA (Multihazard
Mitigation Council, 2005). The study indicates that hazard mitigation
saves an average of $4 for every $1 of investment.
vi Purpose of the HandbookPurP oSe of The handbook
This Handbook is intended for use by State, local, tribal, and private, non-
profit Applicants for assistance, FEMA and State PA Group Supervisors,
and FEMA and State PA Program Project Specialists. The Handbook can
be used to identify potentially feasible mitigation measures that can be
implemented during the repair and rebuilding of damaged facilities after
a disaster �
The Handbook applies to public and private, non-profit facilities eligible
for funding under the PA Program and focuses on projects that are
commonly eligible for hazard mitigation funding under the program. Due
to the urgency in repairing damaged facilities after a disaster, long-term
mitigation opportunities are frequently not fully explored, and hazard
mitigation funding opportunities through the PA Program are often not
fully used. The Handbook can also be used as a resource for mitigation
measures that may be eligible for funding under other mitigation grant
programs, some of which are noted above �
The Handbook contains information about mitigation measures that
address the most common types of damage sustained in wildfires, that
have been shown to be successful, and that can be implemented in a
timely fashion. The Handbook is not a construction guide.

Mitigation
measures are described conceptually, and installation details and
construction methods are not included �
Users of the Handbook are advised to refer to Disaster Assistance
Policy 9526.1, “Hazard Mitigation Funding Under Section 406 (Stafford
Act),” for FEMA policy governing funding for hazard mitigation under
the PA Program. The policy describes those circumstances under which
funding for hazard mitigation is eligible for PA Program funding. It also
contains a list of measures that FEMA has determined are cost -effective
when certain conditions are met (for example, when the cost of the
mitigation measure does not exceed 100 percent of the eligible cost for
repairs). The policy is provided in Appendix A of this Handbook.
None of the mitigation measures described in this Handbook should
be considered pre-approved or automatically eligible for PA Program
funding. The Handbook can be used by Applicants for PA Program
funding as a tool for identifying possible mitigation measures and as the
basis for discussion with FEMA and State PA Program representatives
during the development of scopes of work and cost estimates� It should
always be used in conjunction with Disaster Assistance Policy 9526.1
and with other guidance published by FEMA for the PA Program, as
described in the next section�
How to Use This Handbook viihow To uSe ThIS handbook
organization of Mitigation Measures
The Handbook is organized by type of facility. A number of mitigation
measures are described for each type of facility. When incorporated
into the restoration of a damaged facility, these measures may increase
the resistance of the facility to damage from a wildfire. General design
issues, effectiveness, limitations, and other considerations of the
mitigation measures are also listed �
Public assistance Program eligibility
As with all agencies that provide Federal funding, FEMA has criteria that
must be met before proposed PA Program projects can be approved �
These criteria are based on the requirements of the Stafford Act, its
implementing regulations,1 and policies that FEMA has developed
to apply the PA Program to specific circumstances. Only FEMA can
determine the eligibility of an Applicant, facility, work, or cost under
the PA Program.

Eligibility criteria are described in FEMA 322, Public
Assistance Guide  (FEMA, 2007) � Additional publications, PA Program
policies, and other information regarding the PA Program can be
obtained at www �fema�gov/government/grant/pa/index�sht m or from
the appropriate FEMA Regional Office.
engineering, design, and Permitting r equirements
The Handbook does not list site-specific requirements because the
engineering analysis, design, and permitting requirements for each
project vary widely. However, the Handbook does provide some common
code and design issues to be considered when implementing mitigation
measures and references containing additional technical information�
Repair and mitigation of structural elements most often require a
professional engineer who can analyze the condition of the structure and
determine the appropriate repair and mitigation �
The mitigation measures described in this Handbook may not be
appropriate in areas where other hazards, such as earthquakes and
hurricanes are also a factor. Design factors related to non-wildfire
hazards should be evaluated when mitigation measures are considered.

viii How to Use This HandbookConsiderations for Implementation of Mitigation Measures
The following symbols represent considerations for implementation of
the mitigation measures described in this Handbook � The considerations
are defined in Appendix B.
Project may be cost-prohibitive
Maintenance required to maintain effectiveness
Engineer needed

Weather considerations
Local code requirements
Short lifespan
environmental and historic Preservation Considerations
When providing funds under the PA Program, FEMA must consider
a range of Federal environmental and historic preservation laws,
regulations, and Executive Orders that apply to the use of Federal funds
and require the funding agency to ensure compliance prior to funding.
The size and type of project, project site, and area conditions generally
determine the level of review for compliance that must be performed �
Environmental and historic preservation laws, regulations, and Executive
Orders that commonly apply to PA Program mitigation projects are
summarized in Appendix B.

More information on FEMA’s environmental
and historic preservation compliance responsibilities is available in
CODE
How to Use This Handbook ixFEMA 322, Public Assistance Guide  (FEMA, 2007) and at www �fema�
gov/plan/eh p�
Reviews for compliance with these laws, regulations, and Executive
Orders must be completed before FEMA can approve funding for PA
Program mitigation projects and before the projects are started because
the review may identify steps that need to be taken or conditions that
need to be met as the project is implemented. Project Specialists
evaluating potential mitigation measures should coordinate with
the Regional Environmental Officer or designee for the appropriate
procedures necessary to support the compliance reviews.
Mitigation k eywords
A mitigation keyword refers to a mitigation element that is used in
at least two mitigation measures in this Handbook. Keywords are
intended to help the reader become familiar with mitigation elements

x Overview of the Public Assistance ProgramovervI ew of The PublIC aSSIST anCe PrograM
The PA Program is authorized by the Stafford Act. Under this
program, FEMA provides recovery assistance to State, local, and
tribal governments and certain private, non-profit entities following
Presidential declarations of emergencies and major disasters � The
program provides assistance for extraordinary costs for debris removal,
emergency protective measures, and permanent restoration of damaged
facilities� Under the program, which is based on reimbursement of actual
costs, the Federal government provides a minimum of 75 percent of
eligible costs �
The Stafford Act and its implementing regulations stipulate that funding
for permanent restoration of damaged facilities is limited to work that is
necessary to restore a facility to its pre-disaster design.

The PA Program
may also provide funding for upgrades that are necessary to meet
current codes and standards and for hazard mitigation measures, as
described below �
For more information about the PA Program, see FEMA 322, Public
Assistance Guide  (FEMA, 2007), go to www �fema�gov/government/
grant/pa/index�sht m (PA Program website) or contact the appropriate
FEMA Regional Office.
upgrades necessary to Meet Current Codes and Standards
When a disaster-damaged facility must be repaired or replaced, PA
Program funding may be used to pay for upgrades that are necessary to
meet current codes and standards. This situation typically occurs when
older facilities, particularly buildings, must be repaired in accordance
with codes that were adopted after the original construction�
For the cost of an upgrade to be eligible, the code or standard requiring
the upgrade must:
Apply to the type of work being performed. If a facility must be •
replaced, an upgrade would apply throughout the facility. If a facility
needs repair work only, upgrades would apply only to the damaged
elements�
Be appropriate to the pre-disaster use of the facility.•
Be reasonable, formally adopted, in writing, and implemented prior •
to the disaster declaration date. The appropriate legislative authority
within the applicable jurisdiction must have taken all requisite actions
to implement the code or standard�
Apply uniformly to all facilities of the type being repaired within •
Overview of the Public Assistance Program  xithe Applicant’s jurisdiction. The standard must not allow selective
application or discretionary enforcement by public officials. The
standard must be applied regardless of the source of funding for
the upgrade work; it cannot be applied selectively based on the
availability of funds.
Be enforced during the time that it was in effect. FEMA may require •
documentation showing prior application of the standard �
Mitigation measures described in this Handbook may be required by
applicable codes and standards � In such circumstances, the measures
may be eligible for funding under the PA Program as part of the
restoration of a damaged facility if the above five criteria are met.
hazard Mitigation u nder the Public assistance Program
Section 406 of the Stafford Act authorizes FEMA to provide funding for
hazard mitigation measures that go beyond the scope of work that is
eligible under the program.

PA Program guidelines for the eligibility of
hazard mitigation measures are described in Disaster Assistance Policy
9526.1, “Hazard Mitigation Funding Under Section 406 (Stafford Act)”
(see Appendix  A)�
Users of this Handbook should note that the eligibility criteria for
mitigation measures under the PA Program are much different from the
criteria for funding mitigation measures under the HMGP, PDM Program,
and other mitigation programs� Applicants for PA Program funding
should consult with State and FEMA PA Program representatives when
considering mitigation measures for the restoration of disaster-damaged
facilities using PA Program funding� As stated above, the Handbook
should always be used in conjunction with Disaster Assistance Policy
9526.1 and with other guidance published by FEMA for the PA Program.
xii Introduction to Wildfire DamageInTroduCTIon To wI ldfIre d aMage
wildland/u rban Interface fire hazards
A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that spreads through vegetative fuels.
Vegetative fuels include those that are characteristic of wildlands,
such as trees, grasses, understory growth, and ground litter; and those
that are purchased at nurseries for home or community landscaping
purposes, including trees, mulch, grasses, and ornamental plants� In
addition to the presence of fuel, the occurrence and severity of wildfires
are governed by weather, such as high temperatures, low humidity,
high winds, and drought conditions; and topography (for example,
canyons and gulches act as chimneys, intensifying fires in certain areas).
Different combinations of these factors contribute to the potential
severity of wildfires.
In the wildland/urban interface, buildings and other human development
intermingle with vegetative fuels, exposing the development to
potential fire damage when wildfires occur. Other factors that affect the
vulnerability of development to wildfire are location, weather conditions
during the wildfire, and the fire-suppression capabilities of local
response agencies�
Increase in Wildfire Risk
The pressure to develop land over the past several decades has fueled
the expansion of the residential and commercial environment outward
from community centers and into the surrounding wildland.

In the
western United States, nearly 40 percent of new home construction is
adjacent to or intermixed with wildland vegetation (Firewise Colorado,
2001)� Combined with an increase in fuel loads due to construction
and changes in vegetation, this trend has resulted in greater exposure
of development to the occurrence of wildfire. The result is a significant
increase in the risk of damage to development from wildfire.
This risk is also increased by the trend towards larger wildfires.

According
to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the number of
fires in the United States has declined every year since the early 1980s,
but the number of acres burned has increased steadily every year since
the mid-1990s � In terms of number of acres burned, six of the ten worst
fire seasons on record have occurred since 2000.
Introduction to Wildfire Damage  xiiioccurrence of wildland/u rban Interface fires
Wildland/urban interface fires are a threat across the United States.
According to the National Interagency Fire Center, wildfires occurred in
every state in 2006, burning over 9 million acres.
Major fires in the wildland/urban interface have the potential for vast
destruction by destroying homes and other structures, causing mass
evacuations, and causing injuries and deaths � Notable recent examples
are:
East Bay Hills, Oakland, California, 1991: This fire burned 1,600 acres •
and resulted in 25  fatalities, the destruction of 3,300 single-family
homes and 450 apartment units, and damages of $1 �5 billion �
Florida Wildfires, 1998: This fire burned 500,000 acres and resulted •
in evacuations of 35,000 residents, closure of an interstate highway,
and damage or destruction of 337 homes�
Rodeo-Chediski Fire, Arizona, 2002: This fire burned over 462,000 •
acres, making it one of the largest fires in state history, and destroyed
426 homes�
Southern California Wildfires, 2003: These fires, which burned •
750,000 acres in six counties around Los Angeles and San Diego,
destroyed 3,700 homes and resulted in 29 fatalities.
Southern California Wildfires, 2007: Striking the same region as the •
2003 wildfires, the 2007 fires burned over 500,000 acres, destroyed
1,700 homes, and displaced over 900,000 people, the largest
evacuation in California history.
Wildfire Damage to Public Facilities1
Wildfires propagate by consuming available fuel, including vegetation
and combustible materials.

In an approaching wildfire, facility
components that are combustible can be ignited by embers, firebrands,
flames, radiant energy, and convective energy, as described below.
Burning embers and firebrands, carried on air currents, can travel •
significant distances in advance of a wildfire and land on a facility,
igniting exterior materials, or enter the facility through an opening,
igniting interior materials�
1 As stated above, public facilities and facilities owned by certain private, non-
profit entities are eligible for funding under the PA Program. For purposes of this
Handbook, references to “public facilities” include any facilities eligible for funding
under the PA Program, including private, non-profit facilities.
xiv Introduction to Wildfire DamageFlames from the combustion of nearby materials can transfer to a •
facility and cause ignition of facility components.
Radiant energy from combustion of nearby materials can be sufficient •
to cause ignition of facility components, even if the components are
not on the exterior of the facility.
Convective energy, in the form of hot gases, removes moisture from •
the air, penetrates openings, and can be sufficient to cause ignition of
facility components.
A wildfire can deform or melt facility components that do not initially
ignite. Damage to power systems can cause surges that damage
electrical and mechanical equipment�
Facilities that are particularly vulnerable to wildfire damage include
those that have the following characteristics:1
Combustible construction materials or materials that deform or melt •
when heated
Combustible exterior components or attached structures•
Openings such as vents, that allow heat, embers, or firebrands to •
enter the facility and ignite combustible components within the facility
Features such as overhangs that allow heat, gases, embers, and •
firebrands to be trapped adjacent to combustible materials
Features such as gutters, decks, and fences that allow combustible •
debris to accumulate, providing fuel adjacent to the facility that can
ignite, resulting in ignition of facility components
Interior components that can ignite when the facility exterior is heated•
Although the facility design and construction materials may contribute to
vulnerability to wildfire, the presence, type, and density of vegetation has
a significant impact on the level of risk to the facility.

Vegetative fuels can
lead surface fires to the facility and produce embers and firebrands that
can cause ignition when striking or entering the facility. Additionally, leaf
litter, needles, and other vegetative matter that accumulate in or near
a facility can ignite and spread fire to the facility. Although measures to
reduce or eliminate vegetative fuels may not be eligible for PA Program
funding, these measures are critical to reducing the vulnerability of a
facility to a wildfire and the cost of the measures can be minimal.
1 The order in which these characteristics are presented is not related to their
importance. The vulnerability of a specific facility is based on many factors,
including topography and available local fire suppression capabilities.
Introduction to Wildfire Damage  xvWildfire Code Requirements and Standards
State and local officials have sought to reduce the vulnerability to wildfire
by developing code requirements and standards for construction in
areas where wildfires pose a risk. The codes and standards have been
developed over time to expand fire protection beyond traditional fire
codes that address interior structure fires to include measures to protect
structures from the exterior threat posed by wildfires.
At the national level, the International Code Council has prepared
the International Wildland Urban Interface Code (IWUIC), which
supplements the International Building Code that has been adopted by
many States. The model code regulations included in the IWUIC bring
together requirements for planning and design for buildings constructed
or modified within wildland/urban interface areas. Other nationally
applicable standards, such as the National Fire Protection Association
(NFPA) Fire Protection Infrastructure for Land Development, NFPA 1141
(NFPA, 2008a) and Standards for Reducing Structure Ignition from
Wildfire, NFPA 1144 (NFPA, 2008b), provide similar guidance.
Because the presence of vegetation that could fuel a wildfire is the
greatest threat to life, health and safety, and buildings and other
facilities, requirements for fuel reduction and the creation of defensible
space  have often been the focus of codes and standards for reducing
vulnerability to wildfires.

These requirements are intended to reduce the
rate of fire spread and provide a safer environment for fire suppression.
The requirements are focused on the removal of vegetation, such as
trees, brush, and grasses, to create firebreaks immediately adjacent to
buildings and other structures, and reduced fuel zones that disrupt the
horizontal and vertical continuity of combustible vegetation. Defensible
space is described in Appendix D of this Handbook.
Additionally, codes and standards have been developed for planning,
zoning, and land development components that are designed to
reduce vulnerability to wildfires. The codes and standards may include
requirements to avoid areas of increased risk, such as canyons that can
accelerate the rate of fire spread; requirements for building separation;
specifications for streets and driveways to allow ingress/egress; and
specifications for water supply.
The protection of individual facilities is guided by codes that have
incorporated ignition-resistant construction standards , which include
requirements designed to reduce the potential for ignition, particularly
due to flying embers and firebrands, in areas prone to wildfire hazards.
xvi Introduction to Wildfire DamageIgnition-resistant construction standards  are based on the use of fire-
resistant materials, noncombustible materials , and 1-hour fire-rated
assemblies�
Designating an area as a fire severity zone is based on factors such as
fuel, topography, and weather. The designation includes the potential
severity of wildfire that could occur (for example, extreme, high, or
moderate wildfire severity). The assessment and mapping of fire severity
zones and dissemination of information about the areas provide an
additional tool for planning and designing facilities and development to
reduce vulnerability to wildfires. Many State and local governments use
fire severity zones to set standards for ignition-resistant construction
that vary depending on wildfire severity. The IWUIC provides for three
classes of ignition-resistant construction based on the severity of the fire
hazard in the area in which the building is located.

Accordingly, the fact
that a facility is located in a fire severity zone may guide the selection of
mitigation measures�
Elements of Successful Wildfire Mitigation
A comprehensive effort to reduce the vulnerability of public facilities to
wildfires incorporates the following elements:
Definition of the fire severity zone to determine the potential fire •
severity at the location of the facility.
Establishment of • defensible space  around the facility to keep
wildfires away from the facility and allow for fire suppression activities.
Modification to, or incorporation of, components that reduce the •
potential for ignition in the event that a wildfire approaches the facility.
The last element may be eligible for PA Program funding during
restoration of a damaged public facility if required for repair of damaged
elements under current codes and standards or if it is a cost-effective
hazard mitigation measure. Components that reduce the potential for
ignition, which are the focus of this Handbook, should include:
Noncombustible components that resist ignition•
Fire-resistant assemblies to reduce the spread of heat and flames•
Components that prevent the trapping and intrusion of hot gases, •
embers, and firebrands that could cause ignition

Buildings 1I. buIldIngS
In this section, mitigation measures that can reduce the vulnerability of
buildings and attached structures such as decks and ramps to wildfire
hazards are described.

One measure that is not included and may not
be eligible for PA Program funding, creation of defensible space  around
the building, may be critical to reducing the vulnerability of the building
to wildfire hazards. Information about creating a defensible space is
provided in Appendix D.
Typical damage to buildings:  In general, the factors that make a
building vulnerable to wildfire damage are:
Proximity to topographic features such as steep slopes, ridges, and •
saddles, which can contribute to the spread of wildfire; high wind
condition s increase the risk
Proximity to fuels including vegetation, other materials, structures, •
and accumulated debris, and lack of defensible space
Building components that do not consist of•  fire-resistant  or
noncombustible materials but are exposed to radiant heat, hot
gases, flames, embers, or firebrands that may cause ignition of the
components
Openings through which hot gases, embers, and firebrands can •
intrude and cause ignition within the building
A reduction in the vulnerability of a building to wildfire damage is most
effectively achieved through measures that address all of these factors.
Although the type and design of public buildings vary widely, building
components that are most susceptible to damage during wildfires are
common to many building types. These components are described
below �
roofs: Roofs are the most vulnerable component of the building. They
can be exposed to flames and, due to their horizontal orientation, are
especially susceptible to ignition by airborne embers and firebrands.
Combustible debris may accumulate on the roof or in gutters. Aside from
creating a defensible space, installing a Class A rated roof is the most
critical element in reducing a building’s vulnerability to wildfire.
exterior walls: Exterior walls that are not constructed to ignition-
resistant construction standards are vulnerable to ignition due to
flames, radiant heat, and airborne embers and firebrands. Combustible
materials within the wall may ignite due to conduction of heat from
2 Buildingsexterior materials.

Openings for utilities and other purposes may allow
hot gases and embers to intrude, causing ignition within the building�
vents: These components may ignite if not constructed of  fire-resistant
or noncombustible material or may allow hot gases and embers to
intrude, causing ignition within the building�
Exterior doors, windows, and skylights: Door, window, and skylight
assemblies may ignite if not constructed to ignition-resistant
construction standards . Additionally, gaps around doors and breakage
of glass in doors, windows, and skylights may allow hot gases, embers,
and firebrands to intrude, causing ignition within the building.
Ramps, decks, and other attached structures:  These structures are
often constructed of combustible materials that provide fuel for flames
that can spread to the building. Additionally, hot gases and embers may
ignite vegetation or materials stored beneath these structures, causing
them to ignite �
foundations: Foundations may be constructed of combustible materials
that can ignite. Additionally, hot gases and embers may penetrate the
foundation through vents and windows and ignite material stored in
crawl spaces�
Contents: Building contents are often combustible and once ignited,
can contribute to the spread of fire through the interior of the building.
equipment: Equipment such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
equipment may be damaged by heat or flames or may allow hot gases
and embers to enter the building through gaps where the equipment
penetrates the building exterior �

4 RoofA. Roof
Introduction: Roofs may be steep-sloped (roofs with a slope greater
than 3:12) or low-sloped (low-sloped roofs include flat roofs). The
components of the roof assembly, with examples of these types of roofs,
are listed below.
Roof assemblies have a fire-resistance rating  based on their resistance
to external fire exposures. The American Society of Testing and Materials
International (ASTM) classifies roof assemblies as Class A (highest rating), B, or C using test method E108. Assemblies that fail the test (do not meet Class A, B, or C criteria) are unrated. A Class A rated roof
assembly is recommended when considering mitigation options.
A roof assembly includes all of the interacting roof components such
as the roof covering and roof deck. Installing a noncombustible  roof
covering or deck alone is not necessarily sufficient for the roof assembly
to achieve a Class A rating. Under 406 Mitigation, mitigation can be
applied only to the damaged element. However, when determining the material to repair or replace the damaged element, the entire roof assembly should be considered to achieve a Class A rating. For example, a roof with a fire-retardant-treated  wood shingle roof covering can reach
a Class A rating only if coupled with a specific cap sheet underlayment .
Causes of Damage: The roof is the most critical component of the
building’s vulnerability.

Exterior Walls 19b. exterior w alls
Introduction:  The design and composition of exterior walls, and
consequently their vulnerability to wildfire damage, vary depending on
the type of building.
T• he exterior of wood-frame and steel-stud buildings consists of
exterior wall cladding (such as brick, stone, stucco, wood siding,
wood shingles, or vinyl siding) that is placed over sheathing (such as
plywood, Oriented Stand Board, particle board, or gypsum board).
Buildings with solid load-bearing walls may be constructed of brick, •
stone, or concrete block �
Steel frame and concrete frame buildings may incorporate a wide •
range of materials for exterior walls depending on their design,
including metal panels; glazing; fiberglass or cementitious panels;
in-fill brick, concrete, or hollow clay tile masonry; and pre-cast or cast-
in-place concrete panels �
The exterior of tilt-up buildings consists of pre-cast concrete panels�•
Causes of damage: In general, exterior walls with combustible cladding
are the most vulnerable to wildfire damage. Cladding composed of
combustible materials, such as wood siding, may ignite when exposed
to flames, radiant heat, or airborne embers and firebrands. Once the
cladding ignites, fire may burn through the cladding to the sheathing or
interior, spread vertically to the eaves and roof, or transmit heat to the
interior. Vinyl cladding may deform, exposing the underlying sheathing or
interior directly to flames and heat.
Laps in siding represent weak points where flames can quickly burn
through to the sheathing or interior.

Additionally, openings for wall
penetrations (such as for utilities), may allow heat, hot gases, and
embers to intrude, causing ignition of combustible materials in the
building interior �

Introduction: Vents are designed to allow airflow into enclosed spaces,
such as attics, and allow the removal of excess moisture and heat from
those spaces. They may be installed in a variety of locations, depending
on the design of the building. Common locations for vents are soffits,
gables, and ridgelines of roofs. They may also be installed in foundations
to allow ventilation of crawl spaces. Vents are generally required by code,
which may also prescribe a mesh covering to keep debris out.
Causes of damage: Vents may allow heat and embers to intrude into
the building. Additionally, debris that collects at vent openings can be
ignited and spread flames and hot gases to both the interior and exterior

Causes of damage:  Windows and skylights commonly fail during
wildfires when the glazing breaks. Window or skylight glazing can break
due to a differential between indoor and outdoor temperatures during a
wildfire. The heat differential stresses the glazing and eventually causes
cracking�
During a wildfire, glazing can also become dislodged and fall out of
place. For example, vinyl frames warp and then melt until the window
fails� Firebrands can be blown with enough force to break window and
skylight glazing.

Radiant heat can also pass through unbroken windows
and skylights and ignite combustible materials inside a building.

52 Foundationsg. f oundations
Introduction:  Foundations vary widely based on building type and
design. Many types of foundations, such as concrete slab-on-grade
foundations and foundations that are entirely below-grade, are not
at risk of damage from wildfires. Other types of foundations that are
susceptible to damage in a wildfire are:
Closed foundations, in which the foundation walls are typically load-•
bearing. The below-grade portion of the foundation walls are usually
constructed of concrete or masonry. The above-grade portion can
also be constructed of concrete or masonry or constructed of a stud
wall, commonly called a cripple wall.

The wall encloses a basement
or crawl space, and the cripple wall often has vents to allow air
circulation in the crawl space or basement�
Open foundations, in which the building rests on piers or piles and the •
underside of the first floor is exposed.
Causes of damage: Radiant heat, flames, embers, and firebrands
can enter foundations through damaged windows, wall penetrations,
or cripple wall vents or, in the case of open foundations, may directly
affect the piers or piles, framing, and subflooring of the building. Wildfire
elements can ignite columns, subflooring, and combustible  materials,
such as contents of a basement within the foundation� For buildings with
cripple walls, the cripple wall may ignite if it is composed of combustible
materials�
For mitigation measures associated with vents, wall penetrations, and
windows, see Sections B, C, and F.

building equipment
Introduction:  Building equipment such as mechanical, electrical, and
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems is often installed at
the exterior of a building � Equipment can be mounted on the rooftop, on
ground-level pads, or on exterior walls� The equipment connections often
penetrate the building envelope �
Causes of damage: Building equipment is vulnerable to damage
when exposed to wildfire. The equipment can have highly combustible
components, such as fuel tanks, that are vulnerable to ignition from
radiant heat, direct contact with flames, and ember intrusion. Once
these components ignite, the resulting fire may ignite the building.
Sensitive instruments and wiring are examples of components that can
be damaged by wildfires. Additionally, electronic equipment that requires
a consistent power source is also vulnerable to operational failure during
a wildfire.
Building equipment commonly damaged in a
wildfire includes:

Problem: Equipment mounted on the exterior of a building, such as
transformers and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning units, is
openly exposed to wildfire elements. A frequent problem with exterior-
mounted equipment is the possibility of components igniting or being
damaged by hot gases. Firebrands and embers can enter the interior of
a building through exterior building penetrations required for anchorage
and feed pipes�
Mitigation objective:  Prevent damage to exterior-mounted equipment
and prevent firebrands and embers from passing through exterior
building penetrations�

Utilities 67II. uTI lITIeS
Introduction:  Utilities include systems that are related to power, water,
waste management, and communications. The greatest risk of fire
damage is to above-grade utilities. Underground systems (storm drains,
sewer and water lines and in some cases power lines), by virtue of the
insulating capacity of the earth, generally have a low risk of damage
from wildfire. In power distribution and communication systems,
however, the portions of the equipment that must remain above-ground
may be subject to damage.
Utility components vulnerable to wildfire damage may include:
Utility station buildings used to house equipment such as pump •
houses�
Above-ground utility equipment that is exposed to the elements. •
Examples are tanks, meters, pumps, telemetry equipment, utility
risers, pole- or pad-mounted transformers, electrical substations, and
cell phone and radio towers�
Utility distribution systems such as pipes used for drinking water and •
sewage treatment and wires and cables mounted on poles for power
and communication systems.
Stored materials such as chemicals. Municipal treatment plants, •
commercial operations and industrial operations often use and store
toxic chemicals that can ignite and be released into the environment�
Causes of damage:  Typical wildfire damage to utilities is described
below �
water storage and distribution systems:  Storage facilities include
reservoirs and tanks. Distribution systems include pipes, pumping
stations, treatment facilities, and wells� Chemicals used in treatment
are volatile, are subject to explosion, and can omit toxic gases � Intense
heat has the potential to damage pipes and pumping equipment that lie
above-grade and facilities such as wood storage tanks. Wildfires can also
damage the power supply to pumping stations and equipment used to
control and monitor system operations.
Power plants and transmission lines:  The primary risk is to
transmission towers and the lines that carry the electricity.

High winds
that often accompany wildfires can cause contact between energized
conductors, resulting in power disruption�
radio and communications systems: Systems typically contain heat-
sensitive components such as transfer panels and insulated cables�
68 Utilitiesutility poles and lines:  Utility (electric, telephone, or cable) equipment
is often installed on poles. Poles and lines can be damaged by falling
debris during a fire. Poles are made primarily from pressure-treated
wood that is resistant to ignition but will burn under intense heat�
Power outages and power surges caused by wind and fire can damage
electrically powered equipment miles away.
electrical transformers:  Electrical transformers are devices used to
change the voltage of an alternating current in one circuit to a different
voltage in a second circuit� Transformers can be mounted on a pole
or on the ground � Most transformers contain oil that can burn under
intense heat � Explosions can result when the transformers are exposed
to wildfires. Although most transformers containing polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) are being phased out, some transformer failure can
release potentially harmful chemicals.
utility risers and service drops:  Electrical, telephone, and cable can
run overhead or underground to individual buildings � Overhead utilities
can be damaged by flames, heat, or falling limbs. Most portions of
underground utilities are less vulnerable, but the riser poles where the
utility transitions from overhead to underground remain vulnerable,
particularly when non-metallic conduit (such as polyvinyl chlorides [PVC])
or nonmetallic guards are used�

construction standards (see Section I). For smaller  equipment and
the storage of hazardous materials, use pre-fabricated or custom-
made enclosures made of heat- or fire-resistant material to completely
enclose these items � Install a concrete pad at the base or build a
noncombustible  wall around the equipment to create defensible space �
effectiveness:  For the effectiveness of fire-resistant buildings, refer to
Sections I.A–I.D. Above-ground systems enclosed in appropriate metal
or concrete enclosures are effective in moderate and high fire severity
zones.
design Issues:  Equipment in fire-resistant enclosures must continue to
operate at capacity and may have certain ventilation and accessibility

For example, treat a wood
pole with  fire retardant  or replace it with noncombustible  steel or spun
concrete material � A wooden tank can be replaced with one made of
fire-resistant material such as ferrocement. Install a concrete pad at the
base or construct a fire-resistant wall (see Section IV) around the facility
to create defensible space �
effectiveness: Using fire-resistant materials is effective for reducing
vulnerability to wildfire damage in all fire severity zones. Fire-retardant

78 Fences and WallsIv. fenCeS  and w allS
Introduction: Fences and walls function as physical or visual barriers or
architectural statements� Fences and walls are constructed from a wide
range of materials and often include combustible components such as
wooded posts and railings or materials that can melt, such as vinyl.
Causes of damage:  Wildfire damage is typically the result of ignition or
melting of the fence or wall construction materials� Ignition or melting
may result from radiant heat, direct contact with flames, or contact
with blowing embers and firebrands. Fences and walls have large
surface areas that often contain cracks, openings, and rough areas,
or are wire barriers � All of these characteristics increase the risk that
fences and walls will trap fire elements. The potential for ignition is
also related to the condition of the fence or wall: its age, the amount of
debris accumulated adjacent to or on the fence, and the proximity to
combustible vegetation or general landscaping�
If the fence or wall is connected or adjacent to a building, it may
provide a path for the spread of flames to that building. Conversely,
noncombustible  walls can function as a flame deflector and thus add to
the fire defense of an adjacent building.
Wildfire mitigation measures for fences and walls
are discussed in the following section:

Fences and Walls 79a. fences and w alls
Problem: Wooden fences and fences with wooden components are
those most vulnerable to fire damage.

Vinyl fences are durable, stable,
and in most cases stronger than wooden fences � If exposed to enough
heat, however, vinyl is subject to deformation and melting. Other fence
materials, such as masonry and concrete, chain-link, barbed-wired,
aluminum, and full metal generally perform much better than wooden
fences in wildfires. However, metal may melt if exposed to long periods of
extremely high temperatures.

severity zones.
design Issues: Masonry and concrete walls are visually obstructive but
may act as flame barriers or deflection walls for adjacent buildings.
limitations: Chain-link and barbed-wire fences allow the fire to pass

88 BridgesvI.

brIdgeS
Introduction: Bridges are constructed with a wide range of designs �
In general, they are constructed of wood, timber, steel, concrete, or a
combination of these materials � Bridges have a critical function during a
wildfire to facilitate evacuation and provide access for firefighters. Once a
bridge becomes structurally unsound, evacuation and firefighter access
are curtailed � The result is a loss of access through an area for as long
as several months�
Causes of damage: Wildfire damage to bridges is typically the result
of the ignition of bridge construction materials� The fire resistance  of
a bridge is dependent on the material and methods that were used to
construct it�
The structural components of a bridge are exposed to the environment �
Additionally, bridges often span vegetated areas or areas where debris
has accumulated or are adjacent to vegetated areas, increasing
exposure to wildfire elements. Large, flat surfaces such as decking
provide exposure to wildfire elements, and blowing embers and
firebrands may be trapped in open structural elements or underneath
the bridge �
Wildfires typically cause the following types of damages in bridges:
Decking made of combustible material is ignited and damaged. As •
a result, the decking may no longer be able to carry the required
loading�
Combustible framing in the superstructure or substructure is •
damaged by a wildfire and compromises the structural integrity of the
bridge �
Guardrails with combustible posts or railing ignite � •

96 Retaining Walls and Erosion-Control StructuresvII.

reTaInIng wallS and
eroSI on-ConTrol S TruCTureS
Introduction:  Retaining walls include structures designed to stabilize
slopes � Erosion-control structures include facilities designed to control
the movement of water and sediment on slopes or in drainages� This
section does not include a discussion of post-fire measures to stabilize
burned slopes and prevent erosion, excessive runoff, or debris flows.
Causes of damage: Retaining walls and erosion-control structures are
often constructed:
Of combustible materials, such as wood and timbers•
In heavily vegetated areas and areas where vegetative debris •
accumulates
On slopes and are consequently often in the direct path of an •
approaching wildfire
Nearby vegetation and accumulated debris may ignite and provide a
path for flames to come into contact with the facility. Large, flat surfaces,
exposed structural components, and cracks and gaps in walls increase
the potential for contact with, or trapping of, blowing embers and
firebrands. Once ignited, the structure itself may become an additional
source of fuel and pose a threat to nearby buildings and other facilities.
Mitigation measures for retaining walls and
erosion-control structures from common wildfire damage are discussed in the following section:

Hazard Mitigation Funding under Section 406 (Stafford Act)
TITLE: I.
Hazard Mitigation Funding Under Section 406 (Stafford Act)
DATE: II.
July 30, 2007
PURPOSE: III.
Provide guidance on the appropriate use of hazard mitigation discretionary
funding available under Section 406 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), 42 U.S.C. 5121-5206.
This will ensure national consistency in the use of Section 406 mitigation
funds and promote measures that reduce future loss to life and property,
protect the federal investment in public infrastructure and ultimately, help
build disaster resistant communities.
SCOPE AND AUDIENCE: IV.
This policy applies to all disasters declared after publication of this
document.

It is intended to guide all personnel responsible for the
administration of the FEMA Public Assistance Grant Program.
AUTHORITIES AND REFERENCES: V.
Section 406 (e) of the Stafford Act and Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) § 206.226.
BACKGROUND: VI.
A. The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance
Act provides FEMA the authority to fund the restoration of eligible
facilities that have sustained damage due to a Presidentially
declared disaster. Section 406 of the Stafford Act contains a
provision for the consideration of funding additional measures
(further described in 44 CFR § 206.226) that will enhance a
facility’s ability to resist similar damage in future events.
1. In providing discretionary authority for the addition of hazard
mitigation measures to permanent work restoration, Congress
recognized that during the repair of damaged components
A-2 Appendix Aof facilities there would be a unique opportunity to prevent
recurrence of similar damage from future, similar disaster
events. Such measures are in addition to any measures
undertaken to comply with applicable codes and standards,
although such compliance, itself, could be considered a form
of mitigation.
2. Section 406 hazard mitigation funding and Section 404 hazard
mitigation funding are distinct. Section 406 is applied on
the parts of the facility that were actually damaged by the
disaster and the mitigation measure provides protection from
subsequent events. The mitigation work must be cost effective
and be reasonably performed as part of the work or measure
which will reduce the potential for damage to a facility from
a disaster event. Sometimes, a combination of Section 406
and 404 funding may be appropriate, where Section 406
hazard mitigation funding is used to provide protection to
the parts of the facility that were damaged and Section 404
hazard mitigation funding is used to provide protection to
the undamaged parts of the facility. In these instances, the
application for Section 404 hazard mitigation funding must be
submitted in a timely manner, consistent with State and local
hazard mitigation plans, and approved by the State Hazard
Mitigation Officer.
3. FEMA may provide discretionary hazard mitigation funding
under Section 406 of the Stafford Act.

FEMA, Grantee and
subgrantee’s interests in disaster resistance must be balanced
with the supplemental nature of disaster assistance and
FEMA’s obligation for the prudent stewardship of Federal
disaster funds.
4. Only FEMA is authorized to interpret and implement the
Stafford Act and regulations issued pursuant to the Stafford
Act. Accordingly, only FEMA has the authority to determine
which hazard mitigation measures it will fund. The Stafford
Act and applicable regulations do not authorize State or local
building officials or agencies to determine the amount of
hazard mitigation funding FEMA will contribute to a project.
POLICY: VII.
A. Section 406 provides discretionary authority to fund mitigation
measures in conjunction with the repair of the disaster-damaged
facilities. These opportunities usually present themselves during
Appendix A  A-3the repair efforts. The mitigation measures must be related to
eligible disaster-related damages and must directly reduce the
potential of future, similar disaster damages to the eligible facility.
This work is performed on the parts of the facility that were
actually damaged by the disaster and the mitigation measure
provides protection from subsequent events. Exceptions to this
provision will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
B. Mitigation measures must be determined to be cost-effective.
Any one of the following means may be used to determine cost-
effectiveness:
1. Mitigation measures may amount to up to 15% of the total
eligible cost of the eligible repair work on a particular project.
2. Certain mitigation measures (see Appendix A) determined
cost-effective, as long as the mitigation measure does not
exceed 100% of the eligible cost of the eligible repair work on
the project.
3. For measures that exceed the above costs, the Grantee or
subgrantee must demonstrate through an acceptable benefit/
cost analysis methodology that the measure is cost-effective.
FEMA’s Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) software provides
appropriate benefit/cost analysis methodologies. You can
obtain the software from FEMA by contacting the BCA
helpline at 1-866-222-3580, e-mail (bchelpline@dhs.gov),
or the applicable FEMA Regional Office.

Alternative benefit/
cost methodologies will only be considered acceptable if the
Grantee or subgrantee receives and submits written approval
from the FEMA Regional Office and FEMA Headquarters
prior to the submission of the mitigation proposal. The benefit/
cost analysis will be based on a comparison of the total project
cost to the total cost of the following benefits: 1) damage to
the facility and its damaged contents, 2) emergency protective
measures required as a result of that damage, and 3) temporary
facilities required due to the damage.
C. If a facility has Section 406 hazard mitigation funding included
in the approved scope of work (SOW) and the subgrantee wishes
to restore the facility to its pre-disaster condition and function
without  the Section 406 hazard mitigation SOW, then the
subgrantee must request a change of SOW prior to completion
of the project. Section 406 hazard mitigation funds must be de-
obligated when the subgrantee does not use the funds as approved
in the SOW.
A-4 Appendix AD. Proposed hazard mitigation projects must be approved by FEMA
prior to funding. They will be evaluated for cost effectiveness,
technical feasibility, and compliance with statutory, regulatory,
and executive order requirements. In addition, the evaluation must
ensure that the mitigation measures do not cause a negative impact
to the facility’s operation, surrounding areas, or susceptibility to
damage from another hazard.
E. The costs of meeting applicable codes/standards in accordance
with 44 CFR § 206.226 (d) and minimum National Flood
Insurance Program requirements are regulatory requirements that
are distinct from hazard mitigation. Funding for these costs is
considered separately.
F. When the cost of proposed replacement material for a damaged
component is more than the original material, the proposed
material must be shown to be cost effective.
G. There may be no duplication in hazard mitigation funding between
Sections 404 and 406. Therefore, the Grantee and subgrantee
must be able to identify specific hazard mitigation work that
will be accomplished with funding through Section 406. Section
404 funding may not duplicate that work, although Section 404
may be additive and accomplished on Section 406 facilities. The
appropriate split on a project between funds under Sections 404
and 406 is a FEMA decision.

Sections 404 and 406 funding cannot
be used to meet the non-federal cost share of the other grant.
H. Funds recommended for mitigation measures may be approved
for an improved project if the original facility and its function will
be restored and the mitigation work is still needed, is technically
feasible, and will be performed as part of the overall project.
Facilities eligible for replacement under 44 CFR 206.226(f) -
Repair vs. replacement  are not eligible for mitigation measures.
1. If mitigation measures are approved for the repair of a disaster-
damaged facility and the subgrantee requests an improved
project which will instead involve the replacement of the
facility, on the same site or an alternate site, the cost of the
mitigation measures is not eligible.
2. The cost of mitigation measures approved under Section
406 for the repair of a facility may not be applied towards an
Alternate Project.
I. Early in a disaster the FEMA and State PA Officers, in consultation
with the Hazard Mitigation Group Supervisor, should issue a
Appendix A  A-5Memorandum of Understanding outlining how 406 mitigation
will be addressed for the disaster, including what measures will
be emphasized, making linkages to codes and standards and
availability and integration of other mitigation programs.

potential Mitigation Measures
That Are pre-determined to Be Cost effective
The following potential mitigation measures (reference: paragraph VII.B.2)
are determined to be cost-effective if they:
do not exceed 100% of project cost, •
are appropriate to the disaster damage, •
will prevent future similar damage, •
are directly related to the eligible damaged elements, •
do not increase risks or cause adverse effects to the property or •
elsewhere,
are technically feasible for the hazard and location, and•
otherwise meet requirements stipulated in this policy, including •
environmental, historic, and mitigation planning considerations.
This list will continue to be evaluated and will evolve over time as new
information becomes available.
General I.
A. Drainage/crossings and bridges
1. Drainage structures – When drainage structures are destroyed,
replacing the structure with multiple structures or a larger
structure. Sizing of replacement culverts can be made using
in-place state/local drainage criteria (nomographs). However,
structures need to be considered with regard to a total drainage
system and should not be upgraded without a watershed
hydrology study with an emphasis on downstream effects and
NFIP [National Flood Insurance Program] regulations.
2. Culverts – Where the alignment of culverts is inconsistent with
streams flowing through them (because it has been blown-
out), realign or relocate the culverts to improve hydraulics and
minimize erosion. However, realignment of structures must be
considered in regard to a total drainage system and shall not
be replaced without a hydrology study with an emphasis on
downstream erosion effects.
3. Headwalls and wing walls – Installation to control erosion.
4. Low-water crossings – When bridges are destroyed and where
traffic counts are low, replacing bridges with carefully placed
low-water crossings.
Appendix A  A-75. Gabion baskets, riprap, sheet-piling, and geotextile fabric
installation – Installation to control erosion.
6.

Roadways – Where roadways shoulders are damaged by
overflow from adjacent water courses, stabilize shoulders and
embankments with geotextile fabric.
7. Restraining cables on bridges – Installation of cables to
restrain a bridge from being knocked off piers or abutments
during floods or earthquakes. Also, where bridges have been
damaged or destroyed when girders, beams and decking
system are displaced by storm surges or earthquakes, install
girder and deck uplift tie-downs to prevent their displacement
from the substructure.
B. Sanitary and storm sewer systems
1. Access covers – When feasible, access covers can be elevated
to the hydraulic grade line. There are a number of devices that
prevent infiltration into access holes.
2. Sewer lines – Repair, lining or encasement of damaged
sections to prevent infiltration or structural collapse.
3. Pump stations –
a. Equipment or controls in a pump station that are subject
to damage from the 100- year flood can be elevated. Pump
station buildings can be dry flood-proofed.
b. Installation of camlocks, transfer switches, and electrical
panels to facilitate the connection of portable emergency
generators.
c. Pump stations – If pumps and their attached motors are
damaged by storm water inundation, replace them with
submersible or inline pumps as appropriate.
d. Pump stations – If pump station equipment is damaged as
a result of inundation resulting from power failure, install
switches, circuit isolation and/quick connect capability to
facilitate rapid connection of backup power.
C. Wastewater treatment plants
1. Elevation of equipment and controls that can be elevated
easily.
2. Dry or wet flood-proofing of buildings.
A-8 Appendix AD. Potable water
1. Well systems –
a. Reduction of infiltration and subsequent contamination of
the aquifer. Methods include casing the well or raising the
elevation of the well head.
b. Elevation of controls, mechanical equipment, or electri -
cal service associated with use of the well to protect them
from flood damage.
2. Raw water intakes - Buttressing to prevent damage from
erosion, scour, and flood debris.
3. Water treatment plants –
a.

Elevation of equipment and controls that can be elevated
easily.
b. Dry flood-proofing.
E. Electric power distribution
1. Pad-mounted transformers – elevating above the base flood
elevation.
2. Using multiple poles to support transformers.
3. Anchoring or otherwise protecting fuel tanks from movement
in a disaster.
4. Replacing damaged poles with higher-rated poles, of the same
or different material such as replacing wood poles with precast
concrete or steel.
5. Adding guy wire or additional support to power lines.
6. Removing large diameter lines from poles.
7. Providing looped distribution service or other redundancies in
the electrical service to critical facilities.
F. Above ground storage tanks
1. Strengthening or stiffening base connections.
2. Installation of self-initiating disconnects and shut-off values
between tanks and distribution lines to minimize damage and
leaks.
G. Underground pipelines – Installation of shut-off valves so that
damaged sections of pipeline can be isolated.
Appendix A  A-9Buildings: II.
A. General effects of flood damage –
1. Buildings substantially damaged under NFIP regulations –
Repair, dry flood-proofing, or elevation so they are protected
to meet minimum NFIP regulations. If the building is
replaced, rather than repaired, minimum NFIP requirements
are generally in place as codes and standards in participating
communities and are applicable in both repair and replacement
situation. Section 406 mitigation should be considered in those
cases where these standards either fall short or provide no
protection against other hazards.
2. Buildings not substantially damaged under NFIP regulations
– If technically feasible, dry flood-proofing. Electrical panels,
machinery rooms, emergency generators can be elevated above
the BFE [Base Flood Elevation] or dry flood-proofed. If dry
flood-proofing is not feasible, these buildings should be wet
flood-proofed.
B. Roofs – Because the failure of a roof covering can lead to
extensive damage to contents and operation, damaged roofing
should be evaluated to determine cause of failure.
1.

Low slope roofs – Replacement of the entire roof with a roof
covering with a secondary membrane and a fully adhered roof
covering, such as modified bitumen. Mechanically fastened
insulation or membranes are not acceptable.
2. Roof-mounted equipment should be attached to a foundation
that will resist expected wind forces.
3. Hurricane clips – Hurricane clips for use in high-wind areas.
4. Roofs – When roof damages are due to wind pressure beneath
soffits and overhangs, strengthen the soffit and overhang
material and means of attachment to prevent wind pressure
adversely affecting the roofing system.
5. Roofs – When there is roof system damage or water intrusion
due to damage to roof opening such as hatches and skylights
strengthen the openings or the windows to avoid future
damage.
6. Roofs – For gable roofs damaged by wind, replace the gable
end-framing with hipped roof framing to reduce wind forces
(lower edge pressure; reduced projected wind area) and
strengthen the roof framing.
A-10  Appendix AC. Shutters – In areas subject to hurricane winds, shutters are
appropriate in the following areas:
1. All damaged windows on critical facilities such as hospitals.
2. The lower floors of buildings with damaged windows most
likely to be struck by debris.
3. Damaged windows of buildings with very high value contents
that can be damaged by water (such as libraries and document
centers).
4. Damaged windows of buildings subject to debris from nearby
ballasted roofs, metal buildings, manufactured homes or other
structures likely to fail and result in debris.
D. Anchoring –
1. Anchoring of mechanical and electrical equipment in critical
facilities.
2. For small ancillary buildings that have sustained damage and/
or have caused damage to other facilities, anchor the buildings
to foundations to prevent toppling or becoming missile
hazards.
E. Flexible piping – Installation of flexible piping at pipe/conduit
connections to equipment to accommodate expected movement in
an earthquake.
F. Bracing –
1. Bracing of and large diameter pipes and electrical lines to meet
seismic loads.
2. Bracing non structural interior walls and partitions.
3.

Bracing parapets, anchoring veneer or cladding, and bracing
other non-structural elements that could collapse and cause
injury or block safe exit of a building during an earthquake.
G. Replacement of glass – Replacement of glass with impact-resistant
material.
H. General Buildings –
1. Buildings – Where spread footings have been undercut by
scour, underpin footings.
2. Siding – if siding has been damage by wind, replace with a
stronger siding with stronger attachments to the wall sheathing
and structure.
Appendix A  A-113. Venting – Where there has been water damage caused by water
intrusion through venting systems, replace the vents with rain
and water resistant vents.
I. Doors and Windows –
1. Where damage has resulted from wind and water intrusion
around weather stripping on doors and/or windows, upgrade
the weather stripping to prevent water infiltration.
2. Where damage has been caused by wind-induced failure of
doors, replace the doors with stronger units. This applies to the
door frame, door, hinges, and lock hardware. Both entry and
garage doors should be considered.
J. Miscellaneous Structures –
1. Marine Piers – If marine piers ramps that attach to decking
have been damaged by storm-surge uplift and buoyancy, install
open decking or floating decking with uplift-resistant tie-
downs and fasteners.
2. Signage – If sign panels and their supports have failed,
replace with a stronger type of system of supports and panels.
Consider using multiple support posts and stronger panels and
fasteners.
3.

Gutters and Downspouts – If damaged by either wind and/or
water, upgrade the gutter and downspout system to directing
water away from the structure and preventing interior or
basement water damage.

environmental and Historic preservation Considerations
As described in the “How to Use this Handbook” section above, FEMA
must consider a range of Federal environmental and historic preservation
laws, regulations, and Executive Orders that apply to the use of Federal
funds when evaluating proposed mitigation measures under the PA Program.
Requirements that commonly apply to PA Program mitigation measures are
identified below. For more detailed information on FEMA’s environmental
CODE
B-2 Appendix Band historic preservation compliance responsibilities, refer to the FEMA
322, Public Assistance Guide  (FEMA, 2007) or the FEMA website at
www.fema.gov/plan/eh p.
National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires every Federal
agency to follow a specific planning process to ensure that agency decision-
makers have considered, and the general public is fully informed about, the environmental consequences of a proposed Federal action, such as the approval of a grant. This review and consultation process is used to
evaluate the impact a project, and any possible alternatives, may have on
the environment. The process must be completed prior to obligating funds and beginning work.

NEPA does not require that FEMA limit the impact of projects on the environment; nor does it require FEMA to fund only the alternative that has the least environmental impact. However, it does require
that the decision to fund a project be made in an informed manner. FEMA’s
regulations regarding NEPA can be found in 44 CFR Part 10.
National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). The NHPA requires a
Federal agency to consider, before approval of funding, the effects of its
activities, referred to as “undertakings,” on any historic property listed
in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. The agency funding the undertaking is required to give the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment on that
undertaking. Under the NHPA regulations, which can be found in 36 CFR
Part 800, PA Program projects are considered undertakings because they are funded in whole or in part by a Federal agency. Historic properties include districts, buildings, structures, objects, landscapes, archaeological sites, and traditional cultural properties that are listed in or eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places, a Federally maintained
list of recognized historic properties. These properties are not limited to old buildings or well-known historic sites, but include places important in local, State, tribal, or national history. Facilities as diverse as bridges, roads, water treatment plants, and areas once inhabited by Native American populations
may be considered historic properties.
Endangered Species Act (ESA). Section 7 of the ESA prohibits Federal
actions that cause takings of species listed as threatened or endangered, or the destruction or adverse modification of the habitat for these species.
Endangered species include mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians,
plants, and insects. If a project has the potential to affect a threatened or endangered species or its habitat, FEMA must consult with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services or the National Marine Fisheries Service, or both, before approving funding for that project. While compliance issues may
Appendix B B-3arise with projects involving undisturbed sites or sites in or by waterways,
they could also arise with relatively minor actions.
executive Order 11988 – Floodplain Management, and executive
Order 11990 – p rotection of Wetlands. These Executive Orders require
Federal agencies to minimize or avoid activity that adversely affects
floodplains and wetlands.

Because many PA Program projects are located in
these areas, FEMA must review proposed projects for compliance with the
requirements of these orders. Through this review, FEMA seeks to:
Avoid, to the extent possible, short- and long-term adverse impacts •
associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains.
Avoid direct and indirect support of floodplain development wherever •
there is a practicable alternative.
Minimize the destruction, loss, or degradation of wetlands.•
FEMA’s regulations for applying these Executive Orders are outlined in •
44 CFR Part 9. These regulations describe a specific, eight-step process
for conducting floodplain management and wetland reviews before
approval of funding.

Appendix D  D-1Appendix d
defensible Space
The defensible Space Concept
Defensible space refers to the fuel characteristics around a facility and
how those characteristics can potentially affect fire behavior.

The term is
applied generally within the context of wildland fires and to facilities in the
wildland/urban interface. The objective of defensible space is to modify
fuel characteristics around a facility to reduce the potential for extreme fire
behavior, with the goal of providing firefighters an area in which they may
operate safely to save the structure from being consumed by an approaching
fire.
Defensible space by itself may not save a facility from burning. However,
when combined with appropriate structural mitigation, defensible space may
decrease the risk to the facility. Without defensible space, firefighters may
not even attempt to save a facility from being consumed by an approaching
wildfire because the safety risk is too great. Defensible space is one of the
components that firefighters assess when deciding whether to attempt to
save a facility.
Benefits of Defensible Space
Benefits of creating defensible space around a facility include:
Reduces hazards for firefighters.•
Firefighters may attempt to save the facility from an approaching fire.•
Greater likelihood that firefighters will succeed in saving the facility from •
being consumed by fire.
Greater possibility that the facility will survive an approaching fire •
without sustaining major damage if fire suppression resources are not
available.
Reduces the burden on fire-suppression resources during an emergency.•
Improves the likelihood that the facility will survive the fire when used in •
conjunction with appropriate structural mitigation measures.
Code Requirements
Defensible space requirements vary by location and depend on the training
of local authorities with jurisdiction. All firefighting agencies are not
equipped and trained the same way. A local State lands agency office, local
fire department, or county tax assessor’s office should be able to provide
information about defensible space requirements.
D-2  Appendix DAlthough there are no national codified requirements for defensible space,
there are some general standards.

The National Fire Protection Association
published the following standards for defensible space (NFPA, 2002):
Establish a fuel modification area extending 30 feet in all directions from •
the facility.
Ground fuels within the defined defensible space shall be treated or •
removed.
Live vegetation within the defensible space shall have dead material •
removed and shall be thinned and pruned.
Dead and/or downed fuels within the defensible space of facilities shall •
be removed or treated to maintain the fuel modification area.
Vegetation under trees within the fuel modification area shall be •
maintained at a height that will preclude ground fire from spreading into
the tree canopy.
Maintain the defensible space as needed.•
Propane tanks and other combustible liquids storage shall conform •
to NFPA 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code, NFPA 58,
Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code, and the local or State Wildland Fire Risk
and Hazard Mitigation Plan.
Specific Practices
In Protecting and Landscaping Homes in the Wildland/Urban Interface
(Barkley et al., 2005), the authors suggest creating a defensible space by
taking the actions listed below in three concentric zones radiating outward
from a structure. The measures are focused on structures but can be applied
to any facility.
Zone 1:•  The structure itself. Decrease the ignition potential of the
structure by choosing nonflammable roofing materials and siding, enclose
decks, soffits and overhangs, and removing debris from roofs and gutters.
Cover house vents with wire mesh. See Section I (Buildings) of the
Handbook.
Zone 2: • The landscape within 100 feet of the structure. Surround the
structure by a greenbelt of well watered and maintained plants. Plant
perennials, ground cover, and annuals in groups with individual trees and
shrubs. Surround these islands of vegetation with rock or brick retaining
walls and well-watered turf. Remove overgrowth and dry debris on the
ground every three to five years and prune trees. Store firewood on a
gravel pad surrounded by well-watered turf.
Zone 3: • Beyond 100 feet. Thin native plants.

If possible remove highly
flammable vegetation and replace with less fire-prone species.
