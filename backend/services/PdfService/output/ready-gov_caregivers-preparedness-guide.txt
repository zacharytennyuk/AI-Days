 Residential Safety Checklist 12he fire season is now a year-round reality in many areas, requiring
firefighters and residents to be on heightened alert for the threat
of wildfire throughout the year.Each year, wildfires consume hundreds of homes in the Wildland/
Urban Interface (WUI).Studies show that as many as 80 percent of the homes lost to wildfires could have been saved if their owners had only followed a few simple fire-safe practices.In addition, wildfire-re -
lated deaths occur because people wait too late to leave their home.Your fire department takes every precaution to help protect you and
your property from wildfire.However, the reality is that in a major wildfire, there will simply not be enough fire engines or firefighters to defend every home.Successfully preparing for a wildfire requires you to take personal
responsibility for protecting yourself, your family and your property.In this publication, we hope to give you the tips and tools you need to prepare and be successful.Fire is, and always has been, a natural occurance in the wildland.Our brush-covered hills, canyons and forests burned periodically
long before we built homes there.Wildfires, fueled by a build-up of dry vegetation and driven by seasonal hot, dry winds, are extremely dangerous and impossible to control.However, many residents have
built their homes and landscaped without fully understanding the
impact a fire could have on them, and few have adequately prepared
their families for a quick evacuation.It’s not a question of if but when the next major wildfire will occur.That’s why the most important person in protecting your life and
property is not the firefighter, but you.Through advance planning and preparation, we can all be ready for wildfire.We hope you find the tips in the next pages helpful in creating heightened awareness and a more fire-safe environment for you and your family.

Living in the
Wildland Urban Interface
and the Ember Zone
Ready, Set, Go!begins with a
house that firefighters can defend.A  home within one mile of a natural
area is in the Ember Zone.Wind-driven embers can attack your home.You and your home must be prepared well before a fire occurs.Ember fires can destroy homes or neighborhoods far from the actual flame front of the wildfire.Defensible space works!If you live next to a natural area, the Wildland Urban Interface, you must provide firefighters with the defensible space they need to protect your home.The buffer zone you create by removing weeds, brush and other vegetation helps to keep the fire away from your home and reduces the risks from flying embers.4What is Defensible Space?Zone One extends 30 feet out from buildings, structures, decks, etc.• Remove all dead or dying vegetation.• Trim tree canopies regularly to keep their branches a minimum of 10 feet from
structures and other trees.• Remove leaf litter (dry leaves/pine needles) from yard, roof and rain gutters.• Relocate woodpiles or other combustible materials into Zone Two.• Remove combustible material and vegetation from around and under decks.• Remove or prune vegetation near windows.• Remove “ladder fuels” (low-level vegetation that allows the fire to spread
from the ground to the tree canopy).Create a separation between low-level vegetation and tree branches.This can be done by reducing the height of low-
level vegetation and/or trimming low tree branches.Zone Two extends 30 to 100 feet out from buildings, structures and decks.

-level vegetation and tree branches.This can be done by reducing the height of low-
level vegetation and/or trimming low tree branches.Zone Two extends 30 to 100 feet out from buildings, structures and decks.

You
can minimize the chance of fire jumping from plant to plant by removing dead
material and removing and/or thinning vegetation.The minimum spacing between
vegetation is three times the dimension of the plant.• Remove “ladder fuels.”
• Cut or mow annual grass down to a maximum height of 4 inches.• Trim tree canopies regularly to keep their branches a minimum of 10 feet
from other trees.Defensible space is the required
space between a structure and
the wildland area that, under
normal conditions, creates a sufficient buffer to slow or halt the
spread of wildfire to a structure.It protects the home from igniting due to direct flame or radiant heat.Defensible space is essential
for structure survivability during wildfire conditions.ZONE ONE
ZONE TWO
5What is a Hardened Home?ROOFS
Roofs are the most vulnerable surface where embers
land because they can lodge and start a fire.Roof valleys, open ends of barrel tiles and rain gutters are all points of entry.EAVES
Embers can gather under open eaves and ignite exposed wood or other combustible material.VENTS
Embers can enter the attic or other concealed spaces and ignite combustible materials.Vents in eaves and cornices are particularly vulnerable, as are any unscreened vents.WALLS
Combustible siding or other combustible or overlapping materials provide surfaces or crevices for embers to nestle and ignite.WINDOWS and DOORS
Embers can enter gaps in doors, including garage doors.Plants or combustible storage near windows can be ignited from embers and generate heat that can break windows and/or melt combustible frames.BALCONIES and DECKS
Embers can collect in or on combustible surfaces or the undersides of decks and balconies, ignite the ma -
terial and enter the home through walls or windows.To harden your home even further, consider protecting
your homes with a residential fire sprinkler system.In addition to extinguishing a fire started by an ember that enters your home, it also protects you and your family year-round from any fire that may start in your home.Construction materials and the quality of the defensible space surrounding it are what gives a home the best chance to survive a wildfire.

.Construction materials and the quality of the defensible space surrounding it are what gives a home the best chance to survive a wildfire.

Embers from a wildfire will
find the weak link in your home’s fire protection scheme and gain the upper hand
because of a small, overlooked or seemingly inconsequential factor.However, there
are measures you can take to safeguard your home from wildfire.While you may not be able to accomplish all the measures listed below, each will increase your home’s, and possibly your family’s, safety and survival during a wildfire.Tour a Wildfire Ready Home
Address : Make sure your address
is clearly visible from the road.Inside: Keep working fire extinguishers on hand.Install smoke alarms on each level of your home
and near bedrooms.Test them monthly and change the batteries twice a year.Walls: Wood products, such as boards, panels or shingles, are common siding materials.However, they are combustible and not good choices for fire-prone areas.Build or remodel with fire-resistant building materials,
such as brick, cement, masonry or stucco.Be sure to extend materials from foundation to roof.6
Home Site and Yard: Ensure you have at least a 100-foot
radius of defensible space (cleared vegetation) around your home.Note that even more clearance may be needed for homes in severe hazard areas.This means looking past what you own to determine the impact a common slope or neighbors’ yard will have on your property during a wildfire.Cut dry weeds and grass before noon when temperatures
are cooler to reduce the chance of sparking a fire.Landscape with fire-resistant plants that have a high
moisture content and are low-growing.Keep woodpiles, propane tanks and combustible materials
away from your home and other structures such as garages, barns and sheds.Ensure that trees are far away from power lines.Roof: Your roof is the most vulnerable part of your
home because it can easily catch fire from wind-blown embers.Homes with wood-shake or shingle roofs are at high risk of being destroyed during a wildfire.Build your roof or re-roof with fire-resistant ma -
terials such as composition, metal or tile.Block
any spaces between roof decking and covering to prevent ember intrusion.Clear pine needles, leaves and other debris from
your roof and gutters.Cut any tree branches within ten feet of your roof.

 covering to prevent ember intrusion.Clear pine needles, leaves and other debris from
your roof and gutters.Cut any tree branches within ten feet of your roof.

Windows: Heat from a wildfire can cause windows
to break even before the home ignites.This allows burning embers to enter and start internal fires.Single-paned and large windows are particularly vulnerable.Install dual-paned windows with the exterior
pane of tempered glass to reduce the chance of breakage in a fire.Limit the size and number of windows in your
home that face large areas of vegetation.Vents: Vents on homes are particularly vulnerable
to flying embers.All vent openings should be covered with 1⁄8-inch
or smaller metal mesh.Do not use fiberglass or plastic mesh because they can melt and burn.Attic vents in eaves or cornices should be baffled
or otherwise protected to prevent ember intrusion (mesh is not enough).Water Supply: Have multiple garden hoses that
are long enough to reach any area of your home and other structures on your property.If you have a pool or well, consider a pump.Garage: Have a fire extinguisher and tools such as a
shovel, rake, bucket and hoe available for fire emer -
gencies.Install a solid door with self-closing hinges between
living areas and the garage.Install weather stripping around and under door to prevent ember intrusion.Store all combustibles and flammable liquids away
from ignition sources.Driveways and Access Roads: Driveways should be designed to allow fire and emergency vehicles and equipment to reach your house.Access roads should have a minimum 10-foot
clearance on either side of the traveled section of the roadway and should allow for two-way traffic.Ensure that all gates open inward and are wide
enough to accommodate emergency equipment.Trim trees and shrubs overhanging the road to
a minimum of 13 1⁄2 feet to allow emergency vehicles to pass.Deck/Patio Cover: Use heavy timber or non-flammable construction material for decks.Enclose the underside of balconies and decks with
fire-resistant materials to prevent embers from blow -
ing underneath.Keep your deck clear of combustible items, such as
baskets, dried flower arrangements and other debris.

The decking surface must be ignition resistant if it’s
within 10 feet of the home.Chimney: Cover your chimney and stovepipe outlets with a non-flammable screen of 1⁄4-inch wire mesh or smaller to prevent embers from escaping and igniting a fire.Make sure that your chimney is at least 10 feet away
from any tree branches.Non-Combustible Boxed In Eaves: Box in eaves with non-combustible materials to prevent accumulation of embers.Raingutters: Screen or enclose rain gutters to prevent accumulation of plant debris.Non-Combustible Fencing: Make sure to use non-combustible fencing to protect your home during a wildfire.7
8Now that you’ve done everything you can to
protect your house, it’s time to prepare your family.Your Wildfire Action Plan must be
prepared with all members of your household
well in advance of a fire.Use these checklists to help you prepare your
Wildfire Action Plan.Each family’s plan will be different, depending on their situation.Once you finish your plan, rehearse it regularly
with your family and keep it in a safe and
accessible place for quick implementation.READY , SET, GO!Create Your Own
Wildfire Action Plan
 Create a Family Disaster Plan  that includes
meeting locations and communication plans
and rehearse it regularly.Include in your plan the evacuation of large animals such as horses.Have fire extinguishers on hand and train your family how to use them.Ensure that your family knows where your gas, electric and water main shut-off controls are and how to use them.Plan several different evacuation routes.Designate an emergency meeting location outside the fire hazard area.Assemble an emergency supply kit as recommended by the American Red Cross.Appoint an out-of-area friend or relative as a point of contact so you can communicate with family members who have relocated.Maintain a list of emergency contact numbers posted near your phone and in your emergency supply kit.Keep an extra emergency supply kit in your car in case you can’t get to your home because of fire.

Have a portable radio or scanner so you can stay updated on the fire.GET READYPrepare Your Family
9OUTSIDE CHECKLIST
 Gather up flammable items from the exterior
of the house and bring them inside (e.g., patio furniture, children’s toys, door mats, etc.)or place them in your pool.Turn off propane tanks.Don’t leave sprinklers on or water running - they can waste critical water pressure.Leave exterior lights on.Back your car into the driveway.Shut doors and roll up windows.Have a ladder available.Patrol your property and extinguish all small fires until you leave.Seal attic and ground vents with pre-cut plywood or commercial seals if time permits.IF YOU ARE TRAPPED: SURVIVAL TIPS
 Shelter away from outside walls.Bring garden hoses inside house so embers don’t destroy them.Patrol inside your home for spot fires and extinguish them.Wear long sleeves and long pants made of natural fibers such as cotton.Stay hydrated.Ensure you can exit the home if it catches fire (remember if it’s hot inside the house, it is four to five times hotter outside).Fill sinks and tubs for an emergency water supply.Place wet towels under doors to keep smoke and embers out.After the fire has passed, check your roof and extinguish any fires, sparks or embers.Check inside the attic for hidden embers.Patrol your property and extinguish small fires.If there are fires that you can not extinguish  with a small amount of water or in a short period of time, call 9-1-1.Evacuate as soon as you are set!Alert family and neighbors.Dress in appropriate clothing (i.e., clothing made from natural fibers, such as cotton, and work boots).Have goggles and a dry bandana or particle mask handy.Ensure that you have your emergency supply kit on hand that includes all necessary items, such as a battery powered radio, spare batteries, emergency contact numbers, and ample drinking water.Stay tuned to your TV or local radio stations for updates, or check the fire department Web site.Remain close to your house, drink plenty of water and keep an eye on your family and pets until you are ready to leave.INSIDE CHECKLIST
 Shut all windows and doors, leaving them unlocked.

 to your house, drink plenty of water and keep an eye on your family and pets until you are ready to leave.INSIDE CHECKLIST
 Shut all windows and doors, leaving them unlocked.

Remove flammable window shades and curtains and close metal shutters.Remove lightweight curtains.Move flammable furniture to the center of the room, away from windows and doors.Shut off gas at the meter.Turn off pilot lights.Leave your lights on so firefighters can see your house under smoky conditions.Shut off the air conditioning.As the Fire Approaches GET SET

best chance of surviving a wildfire.You also help firefighters by keeping roads clear of congestion, enabling them to move more freely and do their job.WHEN TO LEAVE
Leave early enough to avoid being caught in
fire, smoke or road congestion.Don’t wait to be told by authorities to leave.In an intense wildfire, they may not have time to knock on every door.If you are advised to leave, don’t hesitate!WHERE TO GO
Leave to a predetermined location (it should be a low-risk area, such as a well-prepared neighbor or relative’s house, a Red Cross shelter or evacuation center, motel, etc.)HOW TO GET THERE
Have several travel routes in case one route is blocked by the fire or by emergency vehicles and equipment.Choose an escape route away from the fire.WHAT TO TAKE
Take your emergency supply kit containing your family and pet’s necessary items.EMERGENCY SUPPLIES

State and Local Guide (SLG) 101
Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations
Planning
September 1996
 FOREWORD
One goal of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is to develop, in partnership with
State and local governments, a national emergency management system that is comprehensive, risk -
based, and all -hazard in approach.Crucial to this system are emergency operations plans (EOP), which describe who will do what, as well
as when, with what resources, and by what authority --before, during, and immediately after an
emergency.This State and Local Guide (SLG) provides emergency managers and other emergency services
personnel with information on FEMA's concept for developing risk -based, all -hazard e mergency
operations plans.This Guide clarifies the preparedness, response, and short -term recovery planning elements that warrant
inclusion in State and local EOPs.It offers FEMA's best judgment and recommendations on how to
deal with the entire planning process --from forming a planning team to writing the plan.It also
encourages emergency managers to address all of the hazards that threaten their jurisdiction in a single
EOP instead of relying on stand -alone plans.This Guide should help State and l ocal emergency management organizations produce EOPs that:
 • serve as the basis for effective response to any hazard that threatens the jurisdiction;
 • facilitate integration of mitigation into response and recovery activities; and
 • facilitate coordination with the Federal Government during catastrophic disaster
situations that necessitate implementation of the Federal Response Plan (FRP).Emergency planners in the business and industry and animal care communities may find portions of this
Guide us eful in the development of their emergency response plans.Industry planners may also consult
FEMA -141, Emergency Management Guide for Business and Industry .FEMA welcomes recommendations on how this Guide can be improved to better serve the needs of
the emergency management community.Comments should be addressed to FEMA, Attn:
Preparedness, Training, and Exercises Directorate, State and Local Preparedness Division,
Washington, DC 20472.

SLG 101: Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  About This Document
Purpose  This Guide is meant to aid State and local emergency managers (also called
"emergency management coordinators") in their efforts to develop and maintain
a viable all -hazard emergency operations plan.The Guide is a "toolbox" of
ideas and advice, not a sample EOP.Each community's EOP must reflect
what that community  will do to protect itself from its hazards with the
resources it has or can obtain.Applicability
and Scope  This Guide is intended primarily for use by personnel responsible for EOP
development and maintenance in State and local emergency management
agencies.It is strictly a guide.It establishes no requirements, and its
recommendations may be used, adapted, or disregarded.Supersession
This SLG is new.It replaces Civil Preparedness Guide (CPG) 1 -8, Guide for
the Development of State and Local Emergency Operations Plans  (dated
September 10, 1990); CPG 1 -8A, Guide for the Revie w of State and Local
Emergency Operations Plans , (dated October 1992); and CPG 1 -10, Guide
for the Development of a State and Local Continuity of Government
Capability  (dated July 27, 1987), which have been rescinded.Authorities  This SLG is issued under authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief
and Emergency Assistance Act , as amended.In this law, Congress
recognizes emergency management as a joint responsibility of Federal, State,
and local government.For the Federal Government, Congress d efines a role
that includes providing "necessary direction, coordination, and guidance" (Sec.601) for the Nation's emergency management system, to include "technical
assistance to the States in developing comprehensive plans and programs for
preparation against disasters" (para.201(b)).Local governments should use this Guide to supplement guidance from their
States.

 disasters" (para.201(b)).Local governments should use this Guide to supplement guidance from their
States.

Overview of
Contents
Chapter 1 explains what an EOP is at the State and local levels, why the EOP is
a necessary part of a compre hensive approach to emergency management, and
how the EOP relates to other aspects of the comprehensive, risk -based, all -
hazard approach.page iv
SLG 101: Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  Chapter 2 describes the approach FEMA recommends for a step -by-step
process of risk -based, all -hazard emergency operations planning.Chapter 3
suggests how to format the results of the planning process in a written EOP.Chapters 4 and 5 list and discuss elements that, if applicable for a jurisdiction,
should be addressed in its all -hazard EOP.Chapter 6 notes uniq ue aspects of certain hazards, including associated
regulatory requirements.It suggests how to address these unique aspects in the
all-hazard EOP rather than in stand -alone plans.The chapter is not meant to
replace hazard -specific planning guidance issued by the Radiological Emergency
Preparedness (REP) Program of FEMA and the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC), the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness
Program (CSEPP), or the National Response Team (NRT).Chapter 7 contains information on integ rating State EOPs with the Federal
Response Plan, so that all levels of government can provide a coordinated
response to communities in need.Please note that, unlike previous FEMA planning guidance, this Guide
addresses animal care and control and gives extensive treatment to resource
management (including donations management).Revision
Process
To be relevant, FEMA's planning guidance had to reflect three basic changes:
(1) Congress eliminated emphasis on the nuclear attack hazard and restated
Feder al Civil Defense Act authorities in the Stafford Act; (2) FEMA and the
Federal Government have acquired a broader role in disaster response; and (3)
emergency management planning in the States and many localities has matured
beyond the sample plans FEMA provided in earlier planning guidance.Also,
FEMA has taken a new approach to dealing with the States: Performance
Partnership Agreements (PPA).With Performance Partnership Agreements,
FEMA trades increased flexibility "up front" for increased attention to  results.This Guide fits the new way of doing business.

).With Performance Partnership Agreements,
FEMA trades increased flexibility "up front" for increased attention to  results.This Guide fits the new way of doing business.

In July 1995, FEMA convened a group of local, State, and Regional planners
to offer suggestions on making all -hazard EOP guidance more useful given
"conditions in the field."This Guide reflects many of their ideas.FEMA will revise this SLG as needed.Change pages will be issued through the

Preliminary Considerations
What an EOP Is
General
A jurisdiction's emergency operations plan is a document that:
Ø Assigns responsibility to organizations and individuals for carrying out
specific actions at projected times and pla ces in an emergency that
exceeds the capability or routine responsibility of any one agency, e.g.,
the fire department.

Ø Sets forth lines of authority and organizational relationships, and shows
how all actions will be coordinated.Ø Describes how people and property will be protected in emergencies
and disasters.Ø Identifies personnel, equipment, facilities, supplies, and other resources
available --within the jurisdiction or by agreement with other
jurisdictions --for use during response and recovery operati ons.Ø Identifies steps to address mitigation concerns during response and
recovery activities.As a public document, an EOP also cites its legal basis, states its objectives,
and acknowledges assumptions.Local EOPs  In our country's system of emergency management, local government must act
first to attend to the public’s emergency needs.Depending on the nature and
size of the emergency, State and Federal assistance may be provided to the
local jurisdiction.The local EOP focuses on the measures that  are essential for
protecting the public.These include warning, emergency public information,
evacuation, and shelter.State EOPs   States play three roles:  They assist local jurisdictions whose capabilities are
overwhelmed by an emergency; they themselves respond first to certain

emergencies; and they work with the Federal Government when Federal
assistance is necessary.The State EOP is the framework within which local
EOPs are created and through which the Federal Government becomes
involved.As su ch,  the  State  EOP ensures that all levels of government are
able to mobilize as a unified emergency organization to safeguard the well -being
of State citizens.The State EOP is of critical importance.Why Your Jurisdiction Should Have an EOP
Government's
Responsibility
for Emergency
Management  When disasters threaten or strike a jurisdiction, people expect elected leaders
to take immediate action to deal with the problem.The government is expected
to marshal its resources, channel the effort s of voluntary agencies and private
enterprise in the community, and solicit assistance from outside of the
jurisdiction if necessary.

 marshal its resources, channel the effort s of voluntary agencies and private
enterprise in the community, and solicit assistance from outside of the
jurisdiction if necessary.

In all States and most localities, that popular expectation is given force by
statute or ordinance.Congress also recognizes State and local emergency
management responsibility in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and
Emergency Assistance Act, as amended:
Ø "It is the intent of Congress, by this Act, to provide an orderly and
continuing means of assistance by the Fed eral Government to State and
local governments in carrying out their responsibilities to alleviate the
suffering and damage which result from [...] disasters (Sec.101(b),
emphasis added).Ø "The purpose of this title is [...] to vest responsibility for emergency
preparedness jointly in the Federal Government and the several  States
and their political subdivisions" (Sec.601).The elected leadership in each jurisdiction is legally responsible for ensuring that
 necessary and appropriate actions are taken t o protect people and property
from the consequences of emergencies and disasters.Comprehensive
Emergency
Management  Governments can discharge their emergency management responsibilities by
taking four interrelated actions: mitigation, preparedness, response, and
recovery.A systematic approach is to treat each action as one phase of a
comprehensive process, with each phase building on the accomplishments of the
preceding one.The overall goal is to minimize the impact caused by an
Chapter 1:  Preliminary Considerations
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning                                       (9/96)  page 1 -3
emergency in the juri sdiction.Mitigation  Mitigation actions involve lasting, often permanent, reduction of exposure to,
probability of, or potential loss from hazard events.They tend to focus on
where and how to build.Examples include: zoning and building code
requirements  for rebuilding in high -hazard areas; floodplain buyouts; and
analyses of floodplain and other hazard -related data to determine where it is
safe to build in normal times, to open shelters in emergencies, or to locate
temporary housing in the aftermath  of a disaster.

 of a disaster.

Mitigation also can involve
educating businesses and the public on simple measures they can take to reduce
loss and injury, like fastening bookshelves, water heaters, and file cabinets to
walls to keep them from falling during earthquakes.Cost-effective mitigation measures are the key to reducing disaster losses in the
long term.In hazard -prone areas, mitigation can break the cycle of having to
rebuild and rebuild again with every recurrence of floods, hurricanes, or
earthquakes.Where  there is a willingness to mitigate, opportunities can be
found.Ongoing efforts might include:  educating the private sector about what it
can do to mitigate at home and at work; reaching out to planning,  zoning, and
development agencies to ensure that hazard conditions are considered in
comprehensive plans, construction permits, building codes, design approvals,
etc.; and creating inventories of existing structures and their vulnerabilities, to aid
mitigation planning.There is also a need for planning  to take advantage of
mitigation opportunities in the aftermath of an emergency or disaster, when
hazard awareness is high, funds may become available (with associated
requirements for mitigation), and disruption of the status quo  makes it possible
to rethink design and location of some facilities and infrastructure.Attention to
mitigation opportunities can make safer communities for us all.Preparedness  While mitigation can make communities safer, it does not eliminate risk and
vulnerability for all  hazards.Therefore, jurisdictions must be ready to face
emergency threats that have not been mitigated away.Since emergencies often
evolve rapidly and become too complex for effective improvisation,  a
government can successfully discharge its emergency management
responsibilities only by taking certain actions beforehand.This is preparedness.Preparedness involves establishing authorities and responsibilities for emergency
actions and garnering the resources to support them: a jurisdiction must assi gn

facilities, equipment, and other resources for carrying out assigned duties.

or recruit staff for emergency management duties and designate or procure
facilities, equipment, and other resources for carrying out assigned duties.

This
investment in emergency management requires upkeep:  the staff must receive
training and the facilities and equipment must be maintained in working order.To ensure that the jurisdiction's investment in  emergency management
personnel and resources can be relied upon when needed, there must be a
program of tests, drills, and exercises.Considerati on also must be given to
reducing or eliminating  the  vulnerability  of  the  jurisdiction’s  emergency
response organizations and resources to the hazards that threaten the
jurisdiction.Accordingly, preparedness measures should not be improvised or handled on
an ad hoc basis.A key element of preparedness is the development of plans
that link the many aspects of a jurisdiction's commitment to emergency
management.Response  The onset of an emergency creates a need for time -sensitive actions to save
lives and property, as well as for action to begin stabilizing the situation so that
the jurisdiction can regroup.Such response actions include notifying emergency
management personnel of the crisis, warning and evacuating or sheltering the
population if possible, keeping the population informed, rescuing individuals and
providing medical treatment, maintaining the rule of law, assessing damage,
addressing mitigation issues that arise from response activities, and even
requesting help from outside th e jurisdiction.Recovery  Recovery is the effort to restore infrastructure and the social and economic life
of a community to normal, but it should incorporate mitigation as a goal.For
the short term, recovery may mean bringing necessary lifeline systems (e.g.,
power, communication, water and sewage, and transportation) up to an
acceptable standard while providing for basic human needs (e.g., food, clothing,
and shelter) and ensuring that the societal needs of individuals and the
community are met (e.g.,  maintain the rule of law, provide crisis counseling,
demonstrate that people do care and that help is becoming available).Once
some stability is achieved, the jurisdiction can begin recovery efforts for the long
term, restoring economic activity and rebuilding community facilities and family
housing with attention to long -term mitigation needs.Criticality of
All-Hazard The centerpiece of comprehensive emergency management is the EOP.

.

First,
the EOP defines the scope of preparedness  activity ne cessary to make the
Chapter 1:  Preliminary Considerations
SLG 101: Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 1 -5
EOPs  EOP more than a mere paper plan.Training and exercises, in particular, depend
on an EOP.Training helps emergency response personnel to become familiar
with their responsibilities and to acquire the skills necessary to perform assigned
tasks.Exercising provides a means to validate plans, checklists, and response
procedures and to evaluate the skills of response personnel.Second, the EOP facilitates response  and short -term recovery  (which set the
stage for successful long-term recov ery).Response actions are time -sensitive,
with little allowance for delay or "mid -course corrections,” and some post -
disaster mitigation issues such as rebuilding and placement of temporary housing
facilities also must be addressed quickly.Advance planning makes this easier.Finally, an EOP that is flexible enough for use in all emergencies --including
unforeseen events --provides a community with an emergency management
"bottom line."From there, a community can proceed confidently with long -term
mitigation  efforts directed at specific hazards.Or,  it can devote more
resources to risk -based preparedness  measures (e.g., specialized training,
equipment, and planning).Whatever the initiative, an all -hazard EOP helps the
community start from a position of relative security.What an EOP Is Not
 Those who draft an EOP must understand what it is not.While this chapter has
called a jurisdiction's EOP --its response plan --the "centerpiece" of its
comprehensive emergency management effort, that does not mean that the EOP
details all aspects of that effort.Other  Types
of  Plans  Emergency management involves several kinds of plans, just as it involves
several kinds of actions.Administrative
Plans  Administrative plans describe policies and procedures basic to the support of a
governmental endeavor: typically they deal less with external work products
than with internal processes.Examples include plans for financial management,
personnel management, records review, and labor relations ac tivities.Such
plans are not the direct concern of an EOP.

 include plans for financial management,
personnel management, records review, and labor relations ac tivities.Such
plans are not the direct concern of an EOP.

However, if it is assumed that
provisions of an administrative plan apply in emergency situations, then the
administrative plan may be referenced in the EOP.Likewise, if exceptions to
normal administrative plans are permitted in an emergency, that fact should be
Chapter 1:  P reliminary Considerations
SLG 1 -XX: Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning     (3/96)  page 1 -5
noted in the relevant part of the EOP.Mitigation
Plans  A jurisdiction may outline its strategy for mitigating the hazards it faces; in fact, a
mitigation plan is required of States th at seek funds for post -event mitigation
after Presidential declarations under the Stafford Act.Existing plans for
mitigating hazards are relevant to an EOP, particularly in short -term recovery
decision -making, which can affect prospects for effective implementation of a
mitigation strategy aimed at reducing the long -term risk to human life and
property in the jurisdiction.Preparedness
Plans  Preparedness planning covers three objectives: maintaining existing emergency
management capability in rea diness; preventing emergency management
capabilities from themselves falling victim to emergencies; and, if possible,
augmenting the jurisdiction's emergency management capability.Such plans would include: the process and schedule for identifying and meeting
training needs (based on expectations created by the EOP); the process and
schedule for developing, conducting, and evaluating exercises, and correcting
identified deficiencies; and plans to procure or build facilities and equipment that
can with stand the effects of hazards facing the jurisdiction.Results of these
efforts should be incorporated in the EOP as assumptions: that certain
equipment and facilities are available, that people are trained and exercised, etc.Operational checks of equipment and communications systems, however, be a
part of each tasked organization’s standard operating procedures (SOP) for the
period between notification and impact of an emergency.Measures to
safeguard emergency management personnel, as well as vital r ecords and
existing equipment, should be part of an EOP.Recovery
Plans    Typically, an EOP does not spell out recovery actions beyond rapid damage
assessment and the actions necessary to satisfy the immediate life support needs
of disaster victims; the EOP should provide for a transition to a recovery plan, if
any exists, and for a stand -down of response forces.

 beyond rapid damage
assessment and the actions necessary to satisfy the immediate life support needs
of disaster victims; the EOP should provide for a transition to a recovery plan, if
any exists, and for a stand -down of response forces.

However, some short -
term recovery actions are natural extensions of response and are covered by the
EOP.For example, meeting human needs woul d require maintaining logistical
support to mass care actions initiated in the response phase, with the addition of
crisis counseling; it would also involve restoration of infrastructure "lifelines," and
Chapter 1:  Preliminary Considerations
SLG 101: Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 1 -7
perhaps debris removal to facilitate response.At the State's discretion, its
disaster assistance plans for distribution of Federal and State relief funds may be
annexed to the EOP.Disaster assistance plans would identify how eligible aid
recipients will be identified, contacted, matched to aid, certifie d, and issued
checks.Beyond that lies long -term recovery, which is not strictly time -sensitive and can
sometimes be more ad hoc .Pre -disaster planning for long -term mitigation and
recovery would involve identifying strategic priorities for restoration,
improvement, and growth; here emergency management planning starts to
intersect the community development planning of other agencies.FEMA
recommends and supports the development of  State and local hazard mitigation
plans to facilitate and expedite obtai ning Federal mitigation funds during the
post-disaster recovery period.Plans Versus
Procedures   Although the distinction between plans and procedures is fluid, writers of an
EOP should use it to keep the EOP free of unnecessary detail.The basic
criterion is: What does the entire audience of this part of the EOP need to
know, or have set out as a matter of public record?Information and "how -to"
instructions that need be known only by an individual or group can be left to
SOPs; these may be annexed t o the EOP or referenced as deemed
appropriate.For many responsibilities in the EOP, it will be enough to assign the
responsibility to an individual or organization and specify the assignee's
accountability: to whom does he or she report, or with whom does he or she
"coordinate"?

For example, an EOP that assigns responsibility for putting out
fires to the fire department would not detail what should be done at the scene or
what fire equipment is most appropriate:  The EOP would defer to the fire
departmen t's SOPs for that.The EOP would describe the relationship between
the Incident Commander (IC) and the central organization that directs the total
jurisdictional response to the emergency, of which the fire in question might be
only a part.Likewise, the EOP would not detail how to set up facilities for
emergency operations, leaving that for an SOP to be used by the responsible
organization(s).The emergency manager should work with the senior representatives of tasked
organizations to ensure that SOPs needed to implement the EOP do in fact exist
Chapter 1:  Preliminary Considerations

(9/96)  page 1 -7
and do not conflict with the EOP or one another.This Guide does not establish requirements for the preparation of SOPs.However, SOPs should be developed by each organization tasked in the EOP.SOPs provide the means to translate organizational tasking into specific action -
oriented checklists that are very useful during emergency operations.They tell
how each tasked organization or agency will accomplish its assigned tasks.Normally, SOPs include checklists , call- down rosters, resource listings, maps,
charts, etc.and give  step-by-step procedures for notifying staff, obtaining
and using equipment, supplies, vehicles, obtaining mutual aid, reporting
information to organizational work centers and the emergency operating center
(EOC), communicating with staff members that are operating from more than
one location, etc.Development of certain procedures is required in REP,

This process may be more important and useful to the jurisdiction's
emergency management community than the final product itself.The
suggestions can be easily tailored to the specific needs of a jurisdiction.Principles
 Developing an all -hazard plan for protecting lives and property in the jurisdiction
may appear to be an extremely difficult challenge.It need not be if following

Guidance and
Training
Materials   The State is a valuable resource for the local jurisdiction.States typically
publish their own planning guides, conduct workshops and training courses, and
assign their planners to work with local planners.FEMA supports State training
efforts through its Emergency Management Institute (EMI), and offers courses.FEMA also publishes many documents relating to planning for  specific functions
and hazards.Build on What
Exists in the
Jurisdiction    If the jurisdiction has an EOP or other contingency plans, they are the place to
start.Existing plans can point the planning coordinator to applicable authorities,
perceptions of risk in the community, members of the jurisdiction's emergency
response organization, mutual aid agreements with other jurisdictions, and more.The planning coordinator should review the existing EOP for questionable
assumptions, inaccuracies, incon sistencies, omissions, and vagueness.Critiques
of recent emergency operations and exercises in the jurisdiction will help the
planning coordinator develop a sense of what needs to be done.Chapter 2:  The Planning Process

Don't Go It
Alone    The planning coordinator's is only one view.If a coordinated emergency
response depends on teamwork, planning for response should involve the
jurisdiction's emergency "team."Documentary research should be supplemented
by interviews with key officials of the jurisdiction's response organization:  They
may have information and insights that the planning coordinator lacks, as well as
ideas that can spark creative solutions to problems.

 spark creative solutions to problems.

Key officials also
determine what staff will be made available for planning meetings and what
priority emergency planning issues will have in day -to-day work, so it is
important to secure their commitment to the planning process.Benefits of the
Team
Approach  FEMA recommends a team approach to planning for these reasons:
Ø The EOP is more likely to be used and fo llowed if the tasked
organizations have a sense of ownership, i.e., their views were
considered and incorporated.Ø More knowledge and expertise are brought to bear on the planning
effort.Ø Closer professional relationships among response and recovery
organizations in the planning process should translate into better
coordination and teamwork in emergencies.Potential
Team
Members  The planning team should be drawn from various groups that have a role or
stake in emergency response.The list below is not all-inclusive.The important
thing is for the planning coordinator to ensure that the planning team
membership represents a good cross section of the organizations involved in the
jurisdiction's emergency response effort.Ø The Office of the Chief Executive.Ø Law enforcement, fire/rescue, and emergency medical services
(including dispatchers/911 at the local level), public health and safety,
etc.Ø Existing planning agencies (e.g., community development, economic

the Chief
Executive
Official
(“CEO”)  Potential planning team members have many day -to-day concerns.For the
team to come together, potential members must be convinced that emergency
planning has a highe r priority --and the person to convince them is the
jurisdiction's chief executive.The emergency manager has to enlist the chief
executive's support for and involvement in the planning effort.To do so, the
emergency manager must show the chief executive what is at stake in
emergency planning: share the hazard analysis for the jurisdiction, describe what
government and especially the chief executive will have to do, color
presentations with images from disasters like those that could befall the
jurisdicti on, discuss readiness assessments and exercise critiques, and remind
the chief executive that planning ultimately facilitates his or her job in an
emergency.Any backing available from the chief executive's office will help the
emergency manager to obtain the respectful cooperation of other agency heads.Steps
 Following are the basics for development and continual refinement of an EOP.They may be adapted to the needs of a jurisdiction.Research  The first step is research.This consists of re viewing the jurisdiction's planning
framework, analyzing the hazards faced by the jurisdiction, determining the

plans of higher levels of government that may be called on to provide assistance.Conduct
Hazard/Risk
Analysis  Hazard analysis is the basis for both mitigation efforts and EOPs.From an
emergency operations planning perspective, hazard analysis helps a planning
team decide what hazards merit special attention, what actions must be planned
for, a nd what resources are likely to be needed.Comprehensive hazard analysis merits its own document -length discussion.Chapter 6 offers some considerations for specific hazards, and the Bibliography
lists sources for both general concepts and hazard -specific information.However, for purposes of emergency operations planning, basic considerations
of process, methods, and sources include the following:
Ø Process  and Methods .Hazard analysis requires the planning team to:
• Identify hazards , to know wh at kinds of emergencies have
occurred or could occur in the jurisdiction.- Begin with a list of hazards that concern emergency
management in your jurisdiction.Laws, previous plans,
and elected officials can help define the universe of
hazards which the planning team should address in the
all-hazard EOP.A list of "traditional" emergency
management concerns might include: airplane crash,
avalanche, dam failure, drought, earthquake, epidemic,
flood, HAZMAT release (in transport or from a fixed
facility),  hurricane, landslide, mudslide, power failure
(sustained), radiological release (in transport or from a
fixed facility), subsidence, terrorism, tornado, train
derailment, tsunami, urban conflagration, volcanic
eruption, wildfire, and winter storm.Keep in mind that hazard lists pose two problems.The first is the possibility of
exclusion or omission: there is always a potential for new and unexpected
hazards (which is part of why maintaining an all -hazard capability is
important).The second is that s uch lists involve groupings, which can affect
subsequent analysis.

 (which is part of why maintaining an all -hazard capability is
important).The second is that s uch lists involve groupings, which can affect
subsequent analysis.

A list may give the impression that hazards are
independent of one another, when in fact they are often related (e.g., an
Chapter 2:  The Planning Process
SLG 101: Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 2 -6
 earthquake might give rise to dam failure).Lists may group under one
category very different causes or sequences of events that require different types
of response.For example, "flood" might include dam failure, cloudbursts, or
heavy rain upstream.Lists also may group a whole range of consequences
under the categor y of a single hazard."Terrorism," for example, could include
use of conventional explosives against people or critical infrastructure;
nuclear detonation; release of lethal chemical, biological, or radiological
material; and more."Hurricane" might include not only high winds, storm
surge, and battering waves, but even the weakened, post -landfall tropical
storm system that can cause inland flooding.It may be necessary, as the
hazard analysis evolves, to refine the list of hazards.− For each of these potential emergencies, determine
whether it has happened or could happen in the
jurisdiction.Some can be eliminated by common sense
(e.g., where mountains do no exist, volcanic eruption is
not likely).For the rest, there are three lines of
investigation:  history (including statistical compilations),
expert opinion, and maps --which summarize results of
the first two.• Profile hazards and their potential consequences , to have
the information necessary for the next two steps (and to set the
stage for other applications of the hazard analysis).The
categories of information and the precision of the data will
depend on several factors.One is the kinds of decisions the
analysis is meant to support.For example, to decide that one
hazard poses more of a threat than another may require only a
qualitative estimate (e.g., "High" vs. "Medium") --but to plan for
health and medical needs the planning team would want to have
an estimate for likely fatalities and injuries.Another factor is the
availability of i nformation and time.It may be necessary to take
a long view of hazard analysis, and have each version build on
the preceding one as part of a "research agenda" for emergency
management.

the preceding one as part of a "research agenda" for emergency
management.

- Develop information on each of the hazards identified
for the community.Of particular interest are the
hazard's frequency  of occurrence (both historical and
predicted or probable, as available), magnitude  and
Chapter 2:  The Planning Process
SLG 101: Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 2 -6
intensity , location  (if the hazard is associated with a
facility or landscape feature) and spatial extent  (either
around the known location of the hazard or as an
estimate for non -localized hazards like tornado),
duration , seasonal pattern  (based on month by
month historical occurrence), speed of onset , and
availability of warning .− Develop information on the potential consequences of
the hazard.This depends on identifying a vulnerable
zone (if the hazard is localized) or relating the estimated
spatial extent of the hazard  to the jurisdiction (by a
simple ratio of the hazard's extent to the jurisdiction's
area, to get gross estimates of lives and property at risk,
or by "overlaying" the estimated spatial extent of the
hazard on a portion of the jurisdiction and determining
what would be affected).Several kinds of
consequences can be investigated; response planning
would be concerned with effects on people (total
affected, likely deaths and injuries), critical facilities and
community functions, property, and sites of potential
secondary hazards (e.g., dams, chemical processing
plants).The planning team can  use both historical
information and modeling to arrive at estimates for
planning.In modeling, the general process is to
consider what is exposed to a given intensity of the
hazard, how susceptible it is to a type of damage or
consequence (e.g., death, for people; destruction, for
property; days of service loss or repair time for critical
facilities), and some measure of loss (e.g., dollars, for
property).

Over time, collection of this information can
be made easier by sectoring the jurisdiction (optimall y,
in sectors that will also be used for damage assessment)
and developing a profile of each sector: e.g., rough
number of structures falling into different classes of
construction, number of different kinds of critical
facilities, rough number of people in different age groups
Chapter 2:  The Planning Process
SLG 101: Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 2 -7
or having special needs, etc.• Compare and prioritize risks , to determine which hazards
merit special attention in planning (and other emergency
management efforts).The planning team must consider
frequency of the  hazard and the likely or potential severity of its
consequences, to develop a single indicator of the threat:  This
allows comparison and setting of priorities.While a
mathematical approach is possible, it is easier to manipulate
qualitative ratings (e.g., "High", "Medium", "Low") or index
numbers (e.g., reducing quantitative information to a 1 to 3, 1 to
5, or 1 to 10 scale, based on defined thresholds) for different
categories of information  used in the ranking scheme.Some
approaches involve considera tion only of frequency and
consequences, and treat the two categories as equally
important.In other approaches, potential consequences receive
more weight than frequency.• Create and apply scenarios , to brainstorm needed hazard -
specific planning provisions and estimate hazard -specific
resource requirements.While it is important to have a sense of
magnitudes involved (whether the single indicator used to rank
hazards, or estimated numbers of people affected), these are
static.Planning is concerned with actions that take place in
time.For the top -ranked hazards, or hazards that rate above a
certain threshold, the planning team should consider scenarios.Using information from the profile, the planning team should
think about how the hazard occurrence would develop in the
jurisdiction.

Starting with a given intensity of the hazard, the
team can imagine the hazard's development from initial warning
(if available) to its impact on a specific part of the jurisdiction
(as identified through analysis) and it s generation of specific
consequences (e.g., collapsed buildings; loss of critical services
and infrastructure; death, injury, or displacement).Through this
initial brainstorming --which can be refined in formal tabletop
exercises --the team will decide what actions and resources will
become necessary.It will also become conscious of the

following chapters of this Guide).• Sources .Sources of maps for hazards would include
compilations of hazard information made by FEMA and State
emergency management agencies, the U.S. Geological Survey
(USGS) and State geological surveys, and the National
Weather Service (NWS) and its local offices.For more
localized hazards, maps from the Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA), maps of 10 - and 50 -mile Emergency
Planning Zones (EPZ) around nuclear power plants,  and any
maps of HAZMAT sites prepared by the LEPC would be
useful.For historical investigatio n, many potential sources exist.Consult Federal or State hazard analyses, as appropriate, to
see if the historical occurrence of the hazard is tabulated by
jurisdiction.Also interview representatives from organizations
on the planning team about their experience.Check local ARC
disaster records.Check police, fire, and other responder
records.Research area newspapers at the library.Check with
utilities and businesses/facilities that have operated in the area
for some time.Involve the local or State  historical society, and
perhaps area universities (e.g., departments of history,
sociology, geography, engineering).Professional or business
associations (e.g., of insurers, engineers and builders, etc.)may
have useful information.Long -time community residents can
even contribute.For expert opinion on hazard potential,  the
sources are similar.

have useful information.Long -time community residents can
even contribute.For expert opinion on hazard potential,  the
sources are similar.

Federal, State, and local agencies;
academic, industrial, and public interest group researchers (or
private consultants specializing in hazard analysis); and
professional associations concerned with the hazards on your
list should be able to help, either through interviews or
publications.Sources for information on the community and
possible consequences to it vary.Ideally, work already will
have been done regarding potential consequences of certain
facility -based hazards --and it is a matter of checking with the
facility and the agency (local, State, Regional, or Federal) that
Chapter 2:  The Planning Process
SLG 101: Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 2 -9
regulates that kind of facility.For demographics, Census data
are available, as  are off -the-shelf computer products that
organize such data by ZIP code.The planning team also should
make extensive use of the information about the jurisdiction that
is constantly developed within the jurisdiction.The local
planning and zoning commission or department, for example,
probably has extensive data on demographics, on land use, on
numbers and types and --with the tax assessor and/or local
realtors' association --value of buildings, and on
 the structural integrity of buildings (or at least on the code to
which they were to be built, and what that code was and was
not designed to do regarding hazard effects).The local public
works (or civil engineering) department and utilities are the
obvious sources for information on potential damage to and
restoration time for the critical infrastructure threatened by
hazard effects.The Chamber of Commerce may offer a
perspective on damage to business and general economic loss.Other sources of information mentioned previously --emergency
service logs and reports, universities, professional associations,
etc.-- also apply.Use of Standard Loss Estimation Methodologies and GIS -Based Methodology
Software HAZUS for Conducting Hazard/Risk Analysis:   FEMA and the States
have committed to the development of an all -hazard risk assessment capability
as a Mitigation objective under the PPA.

Therefore, in the near future, the
process of analyzing and defining the risk associated with a given natural
hazard and making a scientifically and technically valid as sessment of the
impact on a given area or region, will be feasible by using standard, nationally
applicable loss estimation methodologies and a methodology software
program called HAZUS developed by FEMA.State and local emergency
managers will find these methodologies and HAZUS to be valuable tools to aid
them in all phases of emergency management --preparedness, response,
recovery, and mitigation.As early as January 1997, FEMA’s standard Earthquake Loss Estimation
Methodology and HAZUS will be availab le to States.This GIS -based software
program can be used to generate an estimate of the consequences of a
“scenario earthquake” --that is, an earthquake with a specified magnitude and
location --and provide a “loss estimate” that describes the scale and extent of
the damage and disruption that may result.To achieve an all -hazard risk
assessment capability, FEMA is currently developing loss estimation
Chapter 2:  The Planning Process
SLG 101: Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 2 -11
methodologies for other hazards, such as flood, wind, and hurricane, that will
expand the capability of HA ZUS.These are expected to be available in the next
two or three years.In return, States are encouraged under the
PPA/Cooperative Agreement  process to collect digital building inventory and
hazard data from State, local, and private sources and to incorporate that data
into HAZUS with the objective of refining the results of loss estimates and other
analyses conducted using HAZUS.Therefore, local jurisdictions may wish to consult with FEMA or their State
Emergency Management Agency when they begin to develop an EOP to
determine whether their State has obtained and implemented HAZUS and, if so,
how it can be used to help them identify potential hazards and characterize
risk associated with the occurrence of those hazards.Determine the
Resource Base
Agency heads and other potential members of the planning team should know
what kinds of resources they can bring to emergency response and recovery.The problem is to quantify and list them, and compare the resources available to
the resources needed for  an effective emergency response.

 team should know
what kinds of resources they can bring to emergency response and recovery.The problem is to quantify and list them, and compare the resources available to
the resources needed for  an effective emergency response.

Shortfalls may
require negotiating agreements with private suppliers or other jurisdictions.Determination of the resource base also should include a consideration of what
facilities are vital to emergency operations and how they might be affected by
hazards:  Problems that cannot be mitigated should be taken into account in the
EOP, not assumed away.Note  Special
Facets of the
Planning
Environment  The planning team should note geographic and topographic features that may
affect operations --for example, dependence on a single main transportation
artery in and out of the jurisdiction.Planners also should identify special needs
groups (non -English speakers, the aged, the disabled) and where they are
concentrated (especially institutions such as nursing homes).Finally, the
planning team should be alert to demographic and other trends in the jurisdiction
that affect assumptions.Development  Research leads to a written EOP through steps similar to these:
Ø Develop a r ough draft of the basic plan, functional annexes, and hazard -
specific appendices to serve as a point of departure for the planning
team.Ø Develop agendas and invitation lists for first cycle of planning meetings;
perhaps deliver invitations in person and conduct preliminary interviews
Chapter 2:  The Planning Process
SLG 101: Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 2 -12
with key officials.Ø Brief the “CEO” and perhaps invite him or her as a keynote speaker.Ø Conduct a presentation meeting, establish committees for parts of the
EOP, appoint committee chairs, and schedule a follow -up meeting.Ø Work with committees on successive drafts.Ø Prepare necessary graphics (e.g., maps, organizational charts).Ø Produce a final draft and circulate the draft to the planning team for
review and comment.Ø Hold a meeting to incorporate final changes, discuss an implementation
strategy and necessary distribution, and obtain (informal) commitments
to provide information that could necessitate revision.Ø Obtain concurrence from organizations with identified responsibilities for
implementing the EOP.Ø Present t he EOP to local elected officials and obtain official
promulgation of the EOP (advise the local media in advance).Ø Print and distribute the EOP, with a copy (or press release) to local
media.

Maintain a record of the organizations and persons that
received a copy (or copies) of the plan.Validation   The written EOP should be checked for its conformity to applicable regulatory
requirements and the standards of Federal or State agencies (as appropriate) --
and for its usefulness in practice.Further, cond uct of a "table top" exercise
involving the key representatives of each tasked organization may serve as a
practical and useful means to help validate the plan.Plan Review
Consult the next level of government about its EOP review cycle.Plan reviews
allow responsible agencies to suggest improvements in an EOP based on their
accumulated experience.States may review local EOPs; FEMA Regional
Chapter 2:  The Planning Process
SLG 101: Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 2 -12
offices may assist States in the review of EOPs, upon request.Hazard -specific
Federal programs (such as the R EP program) require periodic review of certain
sections of the all -hazard EOP, and may require review of associated SOPs.Plan Testing  To evaluate new or revised EOP, use functional and full scale emergency
management exercises.Exercises offer the best way, short of emergencies, to
determine if an EOP is understood and "works."Maintenance   The EOP is a living document.Problems emerge, situations change, gaps
become apparent, Federal requirements are altered --and the EOP must be
adapted to rema in useful and up -to-date.Remedial
Action
Process  A remedial action process can help a planning team identify, illuminate, and
correct problems with the jurisdiction’s EOP.A remedial action process
captures information from exercises, post -disaster critiques, self -assessments,
audits, administrative reviews, and the like, which may indicate that deficiencies
exist.It then brings members of the planning team together to discuss the
problem, and to consider and assign responsibility for remedies.Remed ial
actions may involve revising planning assumptions and operational concepts,
changing organizational tasks, or modifying organizational implementing
instructions (SOPs).They also may involve refresher training on performance of
tasks assigned by the EOP to an organization’s personnel.

The final component
of a remedial action process is a means to track and follow up the assigned

planning team to make the necessary revision(s) to the plan.Implementing

every detail of the tasks it describes --but the det ails are important to its
implementation.SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning

Chapter 3
Emergency Operations Plan Format
Introduction
 A planning team's chief concern will be to include all essential information and
instructions in the EOP.Poor organization of that information can limit the
EOP's effectiveness.FEMA does not mandate a particular format for EOPs.In the final analysis, an
EOP's format is "good" if the EOP's users understand it, are comfortable with it,
and can use it to extract the information they need.When that test is not met --in
training, exercises, actual response, plan review and coordination meetings, and
the like --some change of format may be necessary.In designing a format for an all -hazard EOP and in reviewing the draft, the
planning team should consider the following:
Ø Organization .D o the EOP subdivisions help users find what they
need, or must users sift through information that is irrelevant?Can
single subdivisions be revised without forcing a substantial rewrite of the
entire EOP?Ø Progression .In any one section of the EOP, does each element seem
to follow from the previous one, or are some items strikingly out of
place?Can the reader grasp the rationale for the sequence and scan for
the information he or she needs?Ø Consistency .Does each section of the EOP use the same lo gical
progression of elements, or must the reader reorient himself or herself in
each section?Ø Adaptability .

 Consistency .Does each section of the EOP use the same lo gical
progression of elements, or must the reader reorient himself or herself in
each section?Ø Adaptability .

Is information in the EOP organized so that the EOP
may be used in unanticipated situations?Ø Compatibility .Does the EOP format promote or hinder coordination
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 3 -1
with other jurisdictions, including State and/or Federal G overnment?Are problems in this area more easily solved by
 reformatting the EOP or by making a chart of the coordination
relationships (i.e., a "crosswalk")?This chapter outlines a format based on FEMA's experience with these
concerns.Again, the format is not mandated.A Functional Approach to the Overall Structure of the EOP
Concept
While the causes of emergencies vary greatly, the potential effects of
emergencies do not.This means that jurisdictions can plan to deal with effects
common to several hazards, rather than develop separate plans for each hazard.For example, earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes all can force people from
their homes.The  jurisdiction can develop a plan and an organization around the
task, or function , of finding shelter and food for the displaced --with minor
adjustments for the probable rapidity, duration, location, and intensity of
different hazards if desired.It can do the same for other common tasks (see
Chapters 5 and 6 for a discussion of selected functions and of hazard -specific
adjustments that can be made).In fact, a critical aspect of planning for the
response to emergency situations is to identify all of these  common tasks, or
functions , that must be performed, assign responsibility for accomplishing each
function, and ensure that tasked organizations have prepared SOPs that detail
how they will carry out critical tasks associated with the larger function.However, the plans for performing each function should not be created in
isolation.Since the jurisdiction's goal is a coordinated response, task -based
plans should follow from a Basic Plan that outlines the jurisdiction's overall
emergency organization and its policies (see Chapter 4).Components  EOPs developed using the functional approach consist of a Basic Plan,
functional annexes, and hazard -specific appendices.These are supplemented by
the SOPs and checklists necessary for implementation of the EOP.The Basic Plan   The Basic Plan is an overview of the jurisdiction's emergency response
organization and policies.

(9/96)  page 3 -3
of operations, and assigns responsibilities for emergency planning and
operations.Functional
Annexes
Functional annexes are plans organized around the performance of a broad
task.Each annex focuses on one of the critical emergency functions that the
jurisdiction will perform in response to an emergency.The number and type of
functional annexes included in the EOP may vary from one jurisdiction to
another, depending on needs, capabilities, and organization.Since functional
annexes are oriented towa rd operations, their primary audience consists of
those who perform the tasks.They do not repeat general information contained
in the Basic Plan.Hazard -
Specific
Appendices  Hazard -specific appendices provide additional detailed information applicable
to the performance of a particular function in the face of a particular hazard.They are prepared when hazard characteristics and regulatory requirements
warrant and are attached to the relevant functional annex(es).SOPs and
Checklists  SOPs and check lists provide the detailed instructions that an organization or an
individual needs to fulfill responsibilities and perform tasks assigned in the EOP.They may be attached to the EOP or referenced as deemed appropriate.Options
 Creating a different plan for each hazard is an option, but not one that FEMA
recommends.The functional approach:
Ø Avoids duplication of the planning effort for every hazard and for every
task, by dividing the EOP into four levels of specificity (Basic Plan,
functional annexes , hazard -specific appendices, and SOPs).Ø Serves in all hazard situations, even unanticipated ones, by organizing
the EOP around performance of "generic" functions.Ø Permits emphasis on hazards that pose the greatest risk to a
jurisdiction, through the use of hazard -specific appendices.

 appendices will make the EOP easier to use.The parts of an EOP can be
structured around the problem to be solved, the objective to be attained, or the
task to be performed.The following format is based on an easily understood,
common -sense approach:   definition  of
 objective, characterization of the situation, general plan of action, delegation of
responsibilities, and information on resources and administrative support
necessary for accomplishing the tasks.Components
 FEMA recommends a format consisting of: Purpose, Situation and
Assumptions, Concept of Operations, Assig nment of Responsibilities,
Administration and Logistics, Plan Development and Maintenance, and
Authorities and References.Chapter  4  describes  these  components  in
more  detail.Options  This is a common, proven plan format that is easily understood.Possible
modifications include:
Ø Listing all agencies involved in an annex immediately after the purpose
statement, to permit even faster scanning of who does what.Ø Setting forth "policies" in a section separate from those on situation and
assumptions or concept of operations.Consistent application of this or a similar format throughout the EOP will help
the reader scan the document quickly for necessary information.page 4 -1

Basic Plan Content
Introduction
The Basic Plan, as defined in Chapter 3, provides an overview of the
jurisdiction's approach to emergency operations.It details emergency response
policies, describes the response organization, and assigns tasks.Although the
Basic Plan guides development of the more operationally oriented functional
annexes, its primary intended audience consists of the jurisdiction's chief
executive, his or her staff, and agency heads.The Basic Plan elements listed in
this chapter --not necessarily in the order presented or under the headings given
here--should meet the needs of this audience while providing a solid foundation
for development of functional annexes.

this chapter --not necessarily in the order presented or under the headings given
here--should meet the needs of this audience while providing a solid foundation
for development of functional annexes.

Elements of the Basic Plan
Introductory
Material
The EOP should be prefaced by certain items that enhance accountability and
ease of use.Among these are the promulgation document, the signature page,
the dated title page and the record of changes, the record of distribution, and
the table of contents.Promulgation
Document   The promulgation document enters the EOP "in force"; it gives the EOP official
status and provides both authority and responsibility for organizations to
perform their tasks.The promulgation document is usually a letter  signed by the
jurisdiction's chief executive.In it, the chief executive might declare simply that
the EOP is in force, perhaps citing the legal basis for his or her authority to
make that declaration.However, the promulgation document also should
menti on tasked organizations' responsibility to prepare and maintain SOPs and
commit them to the training, exercises, and plan maintenance efforts needed to
support the EOP.The promulgation document also allows the chief executive
to affirm his or her support  for emergency management.Signature
Page    Some jurisdictions may choose to include a signature page to show that, prior to
seeking the chief executive's signature, all response organizations tasked in the
EOP have coordinated in the plan's developmen t and are committed to its
Chapter 4:  Basic Plan Content                                                                                         page 4 -2

(9/96)  effective implementation.Dated Title
Page and
Record of
Changes   The title page should bear the date of publication; a record of changes can be a
chart containing a number assigned to any change, a description of the chang e
and/or the affected part of the EOP, the date of the change, the date of its
actual entry into the EOP, and the signature or initials of the person responsible.

 of the EOP, the date of the change, the date of its
actual entry into the EOP, and the signature or initials of the person responsible.

These items should be included so users of the EOP can be certain that
everyone is using the  most recent version of the EOP.Record of
Distribution   This is a list of individuals and organizations that receive a copy of the EOP.The record of distribution can be used to provide evidence that tasked
individuals and agencies have had the opp ortunity to read and understand their
responsibilities, which is a basic assumption of an EOP.To that end, copies
may be numbered and the record may show both a date of transmittal and a
date on which receipt is confirmed.The record of distribution also  serves as a
convenient checklist for distributing later revisions to the plan.Note that the list
need not be limited to response organizations.Since the public has an interest in
emergency preparedness measures, copies of the EOP (without SOPs, call -
down lists, and other sensitive information) can be made available to public
libraries, as well as to media contacts.Neighboring jurisdictions also should
receive copies of the EOP.For the sake of convenience, a long record of
distribution may be treate d as a stand -alone annex and placed at the end of the
EOP, or kept separate as an "administrative" document.Table of
Contents    A table of contents makes finding information easier.It provides a quick topical
overview of the EOP.The table of conten ts should list all sections of the EOP
and be supported with clearly labeled tabs for each section.Purpose   The rest of the EOP flows logically from its purpose.The Basic Plan should
contain a general statement of what the EOP is meant to do.The st atement
should be supported by a brief synopsis of the Basic Plan, the functional
annexes, and the hazard -specific appendices.Situation and
Assumptions  After the broad statement of purpose, the situation and assumptions section
narrows the scope of th e EOP by outlining what hazards the EOP addresses,
what characteristics of the jurisdiction may affect response activities (and how),
and what information used in preparing the EOP must be treated as assumption
Chapter 4:  Basic Plan Content
SLG 1 -XX:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning     (3/96)  page 4 -2
rather than fact.

 must be treated as assumption
Chapter 4:  Basic Plan Content
SLG 1 -XX:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning     (3/96)  page 4 -2
rather than fact.

Policies also circumscri be and affect response activities, and
could be treated either as part of the situation or in a separate section, if
desired.Situation  The situation section characterizes the "planning environment" --and so makes
clear why emergency operations plann ing is necessary.The situation section
should, at a minimum, draw from the jurisdiction's hazard identification and
analysis.The situation section may include relative probability and impact of the
hazards, geographic areas likely to be affected by part icular hazards, vulnerable
critical facilities (nursing homes, schools, hospitals, etc.), population distribution,
characteristics and locations of special populations (institutionalized persons, the
elderly and disabled, those who speak languages other th an English, etc.),
critical resource dependencies on other jurisdictions, and more.The level of
detail is a matter of judgment; some information may be deemed useful to a few
specific functional annexes and presented there.In any event, maps should be
included (as tabs) to support the situation description.Assumptions   Assumptions are simply that: what, in developing the EOP, has been treated as
true for the EOP's execution.These should be included to show the limitations
of the EOP, allowing EOP users (and others) to foresee that some
improvisation or modification may become necessary.It is valid to include even
“obvious” assumptions: that identified hazards will occur (scenarios, if used, can
be outlined), that individuals and organizations are familiar with the EOP and will
execute their assigned responsibilities, that assistance may be needed, and that --
if so--assistance will be available.Concept of
Operations  The audience for the Basic Plan needs to picture the sequence and scope of the
planned emergency response.The concept of operations section explains the
jurisdiction's overall approach to an emergency situation, i.e., what should
happen, when, and at whose direction.

Topics should include: division of local,
State, Federal, and a ny intermediate interjurisdictional responsibilities; activation
of the EOP; "action levels" and their implications (if formalized in the
jurisdiction); general sequence of actions before, during, and after the
emergency situation; who requests aid and und er what conditions (the necessary
forms being contained in tabs); and, for States, who appoints a State
Coordinating Officer (SCO) and how the SCO and the State response
organization will coordinate and work with Federal response personnel in
Chapter 4:  Basic Plan Content
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 4 -4
accordance wi th the FRP (see Chapter 7).The concept of operations will
touch on direction and  control, alert and warning, or continuity of operations
matters that may be dealt with more fully in annexes.Organization
and Assignment
of
Responsibilities   This sect ion of the Basic Plan establishes the emergency organization that will be
relied on to respond to an emergency situation.It includes a listing by position
and organization of what kinds of tasks are to be performed; such a listing
permits a quick grasp o f who does what, without some of the procedural details
included in functional annexes.When two or more organizations perform the
same kind of task, one should be given primary responsibility and the other(s)
should be given a supporting role.For the s ake of clarity, a matrix of
organizations and areas of responsibility (including functions) should be included
to show at a glance the primary and supporting roles (see Table 4 -1 for an
example).However, shared general responsibilities --such as developing  SOPs -
-should not be neglected.The listing by organizations might also include
organizations not under jurisdictional control, if they have defined responsibilities
for responding to emergencies that might occur in the jurisdiction.The following are examples of the types of tasking that should be assigned to
agencies, organization chiefs, and individuals in the Basic Plan (but please note
that specific tasking related to the critical operational activities each organization
is responsible for accompli shing are detailed in each of the functional annexes to
the EOP and are addressed in  Chapter 5 of this Guide).

, ordinances, executive orders, regulations, and fo rmal
agreements relevant to emergencies should be listed.

The legal basis should
include predelegation of emergency authorities, i.e., enabling measures sufficient
to ensure that specific emergency -related authorities can be exercised by the
elected or ap pointed leadership or their designated successors.It is important
to specify the extent and limits of the emergency authorities granted to the
“CEO,” the circumstances under which these authorities become effective, and
when they would be terminated.Citing reference materials --including related plans of other levels of government -
-can be valuable for indicating what has influenced the writing of the EOP.References also help reduce the size of an EOP by directing the user to the full
text of procedures , data analyses, and other pertinent information.page 5 -1

Functional Annex Content
Content
 Annexes are the parts of the EOP that begin to provide specific information and
direction.Annexes should focus on operations: what the functio n is and who is
responsible for carrying it out.While the Basic Plan provides information
relevant to the EOP as a whole, annexes should emphasize responsibilities,
tasks, and operational actions that pertain to the function being covered.Annexes shoul d cover, in general terms, the activities to be performed by
anyone with a responsibility under the function.An annex should identify
actions that not only ensure effective response but also aid in preparing for
emergencies and disasters.Annexes should  clearly define and describe the policies, processes, roles, and
responsibilities inherent in the various functions before, during, and after any
emergency period.To ensure adequate planning for all appropriate
contingencies, it may be necessary to spend  time projecting the consequences
of various emergencies.This should not be restricted to those hazards found to
be most threatening during the hazard analysis.For example, airplane crashes,
while infrequent, can occur almost anywhere with little or no  warning.The term
"generic" has been used to describe these functional annexes that are generally
applicable to all hazards.The generic annexes are critically important parts of
the plan, since they must enable the jurisdiction to cope with any unfores een
emergency.In general, the organization of the annexes parallels that of the Basic Plan.

emergency.In general, the organization of the annexes parallels that of the Basic Plan.

Specific sections can be developed to expand upon --but not to
repeat --information contained in the Basic Plan.Functions To Include as Annexes
 One of the m ore important things to be done early in the planning process is to
select the functions that will be the subjects of separate annexes.These choices
are influenced by such factors as the organizational structures of the State and
local governments, the ca pabilities of the jurisdiction's emergency services

(9/96)  agencies, and the established policy or intentions with respect to the concept of
operations.No single listing of functional annexes, therefore, can be prescribed
for all jurisdictions.The following  list of functional annexes addresses core functions that warrant
attention and may require that specific actions be taken during emergency
response operations:
Ø Direction and Control
Ø Communications
Ø Warning
Ø Emergency Public Information
Ø Evacuation
Ø Mass  Care
Ø Health and Medical Services
Ø Resource Management
The fact that several functions are not included in the list does not mean that
they are regarded as less important than the ones that are included.Each
jurisdiction's planning team should assess it s own need for functional annexes.Additional or different functional annexes should be prepared at the discretion
of the planning team.Typical candidate annexes include: damage assessment,
search and rescue, emergency services, aviation operations, and  radiological
protection, among others.The primary concern is that all important activities be
covered properly in the plan.The location or categorization of these activities is
of secondary importance, though a State should strive for consistency amon g its
jurisdictions to facilitate coordination.Description of  Core Functions

functional annexes listed above.

(9/96)  Attachment A
Direction and Control
Introduction
 Direction and control is a critical emergency management function.During the
applicable phases (pre -, trans -, and post -) of the emergency response effort, it
allows the jurisdiction to:
Ø Analyze the emergency situation and decide how to respond quick ly,
appropriately, and effectively.Ø Direct and coordinate the efforts of the jurisdiction's various response
forces.Ø Coordinate with the response efforts of other jurisdictions.Ø Use available resources efficiently and effectively.The manner in which t he situation is managed will determine the effectiveness of
the overall operation.Field forces (e.g., fire, law enforcement, public works,
medical, etc.)can and usually do perform admirably in emergency situations.Where problems often arise is in the overall management of the operation: the
merging of varying disciplines, organizations, and agencies not accustomed to
working together on a day -to-day basis.Some jurisdictions may choose to
address emergency services’ (fire, law enforcement, public work s, etc.)responsibilities for managing the response to emergency and disaster situations
in separate annexes.Direction and control as presented here addresses all of
the activities associated with managing the response and incorporates the
organizational  tasking for these emergency services into a single functional
annex.The focus is on the critical operations  the jurisdiction’s emergency
response organization should perform in response to an emergency.

 services into a single functional
annex.The focus is on the critical operations  the jurisdiction’s emergency
response organization should perform in response to an emergency.

Direction and control functions may well be lon g term in nature, changing
significantly as the situation moves from response to recovery.This function
may be initiated immediately upon the onset of an event, such as when an
Attachment A:  Direction and Control                                                                          page 5 -A-2
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  earthquake or tornado occurs, or develop gradually as the situation
deteriora tes, such as when a hurricane or widespread flood occurs.Composition of the staff assigned to the direction and control function may
change significantly, as the situation progresses through the various stages of an
emergency, into the recovery phase.R egardless of the phase or phases,
direction and control is a vital function that must be performed when a
jurisdiction responds to any emergency situation.Developing a Direction and Control Annex
 Suggested content to be addressed in a direction  and control annex includes the
following items.Purpose    This section provides overview information on the means the jurisdiction will use
to direct and control those activities of government that are essential to saving
lives, protecting property, and  restoring government services during and
following emergency situations.Situation and
Assumptions  This section describes the environment that would trigger notification/activation
of response personnel.It also describes the assumptions that are app licable to
the emergency response organization.It may address capability limitations,
resource shortfall, use of personnel or resources from outside of the jurisdiction
(mutual aid) to augment the jurisdiction's response organization, or other things
that directly impact on the ability of the jurisdiction to respond to emergency
situations.A fundamental assumption is that the EOC will be operational
around the clock.Concept of
Operations

(9/96)  page 5 -A-3
Ø How emergency response organizations will be notified when it is
necessary to respond.Ø The means that will be used to obtain, analyze, and disseminate
information (for decision -making, requesting assistance, reporting, etc.).Ø The relat ionship between the EOC and the Incident Command Post
(ICP), when used.Ø The provisions made to coordinate and communicate among all the
jurisdictions and agencies (to include all Federal response agencies) that
may be involved in the emergency response.Direction and
Control Types
The emergency response command structure should be established before an
emergency occurs.Once the response begins, there should be no confusion
about who is in charge and who reports to whom.Agreeing on the command
structure beforehand helps to ensure that all people involved understand their
responsibilities and are ready to implement them when an emergency occurs.Normally, jurisdictions use a centralized direction and control system, an on -
scene control system, or a combination of the two.Ø Centralized .This is the use of the EOC as a centralized management
center to facilitate policy making, coordination, and overall direction of
responding forces in large -scale emergency situations.The “CEO” of
the jurisdiction  or the appropriate designee directs all response and
recovery activities from the EOC.This method is used by many
jurisdictions and is very useful in situations where the jurisdiction has
received warning that, within a given time period (e.g., 72 hours) , it may
experience the effects of a specific threat (e.g., hurricane, riverine flood,
etc.).In such situations there are a number of operational actions and
measures that must be taken before  the consequences of the disaster
directly impact on the juris diction or an incident site is established.These include issuance of emergency information to the public,
suspension or curtailment of government and public services (health,

; school and business closure;
cancellati on of public events, etc.), evacuation actions, mass care
activities (to include set up and staffing of shelters to receive, feed, and
care for evacuees).This method is also useful in situations where the
jurisdiction is struck by a large -scale disaster (e.g., earthquake) that
severely impacts the entire jurisdiction with little or no warning.In such
situations, centralized direction of response organizations provides the
“CEO” an opportunity to:
• Get a clear picture of the scope of the situation throug hout the
jurisdiction based on information received in the EOC.• Work closely with the appropriate representatives from the
emergency services organizations (fire, police, public works,
health and medical) and other supporting agencies so that
response ac tions and activities can be prioritized based on the
overall situation in the jurisdiction.• Redirect or adjust response actions and use of resources to
meet the needs of disaster victims and protect property as the
situation warrants.Ø On-Scene Cont rol System .While central control of the emergency
response is critically important, the actions that actually minimize the
impacts of the emergency event and save lives are performed by
responders in the field.Accordingly, an on -scene control system ma y
be used instead of a centralized system.The on -scene control system
vests the responsibility for the direction and control of all response
actions with an individual that has responded to the scene of an
emergency.This “Incident Commander” or IC has authority to
coordinate the use of resources and personnel at the scene of an
emergency.In some communities, the highest ranking person from the
jurisdiction on the scene, regardless of his or her agency, is responsible
for incident command.Under this arrangement, a fire department
official may direct fire, police, and personnel from the jurisdiction's other
departments.Incident command responsibility may change as higher
Attachment A:  Direction and Control

(9/96)  page 5 -A-5
level personnel arrive on the scene.

96)  page 5 -A-5
level personnel arrive on the scene.

In other communities, the individual
desig nated to serve as IC may depend on the type of event (i.e., the IC
will be from an agency responsible for that kind of event), management
fiat, or statute.Coordination is one of the key goals of planning for the field command
structure.The response may  involve personnel from several of the
jurisdiction's agencies, employees from other nearby jurisdictions,
personnel from other levels of government, as well as volunteers.The
mechanisms that will be used to coordinate the efforts of all of these
differe nt types of responders should be established before the
emergency occurs.Federal HAZMAT regulations and a growing number of State laws
mandate the use of an Incident Command System (ICS).ICS is
designed around sound business practices that provide a common
framework for emergency response.ICS places a high degree of
importance on responder safety.The ICS system provides a
standardized means to command, control, and coordinate the use of
resources and personnel at the scene  of an emergency.Conc epts and
principles for ICS include:  common terminology, modular organization,
integrated communications, unified command structure, consolidated
action plan, manageable span of control, designated incident facilities,
and comprehensive resource managemen t.  ICS concentrates direction
and control actions on the field operations of the emergency services
organizations that have responded to the scene of an emergency.ICS
uses a top -down direction and control structure that includes five
functions: Command,  Operations, Planning, Logistics, and
Finance/Administration.• Incident Command .ICS is “scene specific.”  The function of
the IC is to provide overall management at the incident site,
including public safety and public information actions.The IC
directs, controls, and orders resources, including people and
equipment.(When more than one scene is involved, the ICs
coordinate activities with the EOC.)The IC will develop a
Attachment A:  Direction and Control

(9/96)  page 5 -A-5
management structure  based on the needs of the incident as
articulated in the in cident action plan.A small, simple incident
will have a small management structure.

9/96)  page 5 -A-5
management structure  based on the needs of the incident as
articulated in the in cident action plan.A small, simple incident
will have a small management structure.

As incidents grow in
size and complexity, the management structure grows
accordingly.• Operations .The operations function is coordinated by the
Operations Section Ch ief who reports to the IC.Operations is
responsible for the tactical actions at the incident site.All
tactical actions are performed in accordance with the Incident
Action Plan.• Planning .The planning function is coordinated by the Planning
Section  Chief who reports directly to the IC.The Planning
function is responsible for the collection, evaluation,
documentation, dissemination, and use of information about the
incident, as well as the status of resources used or needed at the
scene.The Plann ing Section is also responsible for preparation
of the Incident Action Plan.For small incidents of short
duration this plan may be oral or written.Written action plans
should be used: when resources from multiple agencies are
being used, when several j urisdictions are involved, or when the
incident will require changes in shifts of personnel and/or
equipment.• Logistics .The logistics function is coordinated by the Logistics
Chief who reports to the IC.The logistics function is
responsible for provi ding facilities, services, personnel,
equipment, and materials for the incident.• Finance/Administration .The finance/administration function is
coordinated by the Finance Section Chief who reports to the
IC.This function is responsible for the tracki ng of all incident
costs, evaluating the financial considerations of the incident, and
for any administrative duties not handled by the other functions.• Command Staff and the Command Post .During response
operations the IC and staff are located in the  ICP.The IC's
staff may include:
Attachment A:  Direction and Control

(9/96)  page 5 -A-7
− A Safety Officer who is responsible for assessing the
hazards response personnel may be exposed to and
developing measures to ensure personnel safety.− An Information Officer who is responsible for
developing accurate and complete information
applicable to the incident, including cause, size, current
situation, resources committed, and other matters of
general interest.This person also serves as the point of
contact for the media and other governmental agencies
which desire information directly from the incident
scene.

 resources committed, and other matters of
general interest.This person also serves as the point of
contact for the media and other governmental agencies
which desire information directly from the incident
scene.

− A Liaison Officer who is responsible for serving as a
point of contact with organizations that are supporting
the response effort, but not part of the command
structure located at the incident scene.From the ICP the Incident Commander directs all operations.The ICP can take various forms from a specially designed
vehicle to an identified emergency response vehicle and is
located as close to the scene as practical.A detailed description of the  Incident Command System can be found in the
National Fire Academy’s NFA -ICS-SM, The Incident Command System , August
1, 1989 and the Emergency Management Institute’s SM 307.1, Overview of the
Incident Command System , April 1992.Ø Transition .It i s vital to understand that only one person can be "in
charge" during response and recovery operations.Sometimes it is
appropriate for an IC to be that person; at other times the critical
decisions must be made away from the site or before a defined incid ent
site or sites are established, at the EOC.In the two situations given
below, direction and control may transition from the scene(s) to the
EOC or from the EOC to the scene(s).A direction and control annex
should explain the direction and control sy stem to be used.It should
Attachment A:  Direction and Control
SLG 101:  Guide for Al l-Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -A-8
clarify the relationship between the centralized command authority and
the IC when both ICS and centralized methods of direction and control
are used, and anticipate “shifts” in the location (incident site or EOC)
and the individ ual (IC or “CEO”) responsible for decision -making.• From EOC to Scene.For some emergencies, the establishment
of an emergency scene (or "incident site") may not be possible
or appropriate during the initial response phase.Also, several
operationally rel ated actions may be required to be completed
before an emergency scene is established.Accordingly, many
of the initial "response" actions that must be taken should be
accomplished in the EOC.

 be taken should be
accomplished in the EOC.

As the consequences of the
emergency situation become clearer  and when a specific
emergency scene is defined, command may be transitioned to
an IC that has responded to the scene.Once command
authority is transitioned to the IC, the EOC would provide
support, and would not be responsible for operational decision -
making.• From Multiple Scenes to the EOC .As emergencies escalate
into large -scale disaster proportions, more than one scene (and
thus more than one IC) can become involved.As this happens,
it is especially important for field operations to be coordinate d
through the EOC.Each IC is advised of the expanding scope
of operations and is cautioned to be aware of the developing
competition for resources.It is in setting priorities for the
allocation of scarce resources that the EOC may be said to
“control” the response..Interjurisdictiona
l Relationships
  The concept of operations section should also address the formal arrangements
that have been established to request assistance from or to provide assistance to
other jurisdictions during emergency situ ations.The plan should be based on
the concept that initial emergency response will, to the maximum extent
possible, be by the jurisdiction.Assistance needed will be obtained by
executing mutual aid agreements.Assistance to take care of other unmet ne eds
should be referred to the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA).If
Attachment A:  Direction and Control
SLG 101:  Guide for Al l-Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -A-8
still more assistance is needed beyond State capabilities, SEMA should
coordinate requests with the proper Federal agencies, including a request to
FEMA for a Presidential declarat ion of an emergency or major disaster to allow
supplemental Federal financial and technical assistance to be provided.Organization

Communications
Introduction
 This function focuses on the communications systems that will be relied upon
during emergency situations.The total communications system is discussed in
detail and procedures for its use are outlined.Developing a Communications Annex
Purpose    A communications annex provides information on establishing, using,
maintaining, augmenting, and providing backup for all of the types of
communications devices needed during emergency response operations.Situation and
Assumptions  The Situation portion of this section identifies some broad considerations that
apply to the kinds of emergency conditions that could occur and would require
the activation of emergency communications systems to support the
jurisdiction's response to the situation.This section also describes the assumptions that are applicable to the
communications system the jurisdiction will use during emergency operations.Typical assumptions may address:
Ø Recognition of the fact that large-scale emergency operations usually
require a communications capability beyond the normal capacities of the
equipment of a local government.

 of a local government.

Therefore, the type required and
sources (from the public and private sector) for the additional
equipment ne eded to support response operations should be identified
as a fundamental activity associated with developing this annex of the
plan.Ø Augmentation of local capability by higher levels of government.Ø The support provided by the local chapter of RACES.If  RACES is
not available locally, other public service and private organizations in the

industry, taxi and transit companies, citizens band radio groups (e.g.,
REACT), and local service a gencies.Ø Designation of specific response organizations to maintain operational
control of their own communications systems,  while coordinating with
the EOC during emergency operations.Ø The spontaneous voluntary support of ham radio operators, radio clubs,
and private organizations with sophisticated communications equipment.Concept of
Operations   This section should describe the methods used to communicate between the
EOC, field forces at a specific incident scene (operating under ICS or another
direction and control system), control centers of emergency response
organizations, mass care facilities (including shelters and feeding facilities),
radio/TV stations, hospitals and ambulance dispatch points, amateur
communications networks, adjacent juris dictions and military installations, State
EOC, and Federal and private sector organizations, as appropriate.It should
address sourcing for primary and backup systems, the people that will operate
the equipment, and detail the communications requirements  for emergency

Warning
Introduction
 This function deals with the dissemination to the appropriate government
officials and the public timely forecasts  of all hazards requiring emergency
response actions.This warning information is vital and must be made available
in order to ensure that emergency responders and the public take appropriate
protective actions to avoid death, injury, and/or damage to pro perty.Developing a Warning Annex
Purpose  A warning annex describes the warning systems in place in the jurisdiction and
the responsibilities and procedures for using them.All components of the
system should be identified and the provisions that h ave been made to
implement warning described.Situation and
Assumptions
 This section identifies some broad considerations that apply to the kinds of
emergency conditions that could require the activation of emergency warning
systems.It identifies the warning sites that will be relied upon to alert
emergency responders and warn the public.This section also describes the assumptions that are applicable to the warning
systems the jurisdiction may use during emergency operations.

gency responders and warn the public.This section also describes the assumptions that are applicable to the warning
systems the jurisdiction may use during emergency operations.

Typical are
assumptions  that:
Ø Some people who are directly threatened by a hazard may ignore, not
hear, or not understand warnings issued by the government.Ø Special needs groups such as the hearing -impaired, sight -impaired,
physically disabled, or institutionalized (e.g., in  mental treatment
facilities, jails/prisons/detention facilities, etc.)require special attention to
ensure a workable warning system is established.Ø Emergency response organizations such as the fire and police may be
called upon to help warn the public.page 5 -C-1
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)
 Ø Where available, EAS stations will be used to help disseminate warning
information.Ø Radio/TV stations which are not members of the EAS station network
will be willing to issue warning announcements.Ø Where available, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) Weather Radio stations will disseminate watches and
warnings issued by the NWS; NOAA tone alert radios are
automatically activated when such watches and warnings are issued.Concept of
Operations  This section of the annex provides g eneral information on how warnings will be
given within the jurisdiction and in cooperation with other jurisdictions.General    This section:
Ø Describes the methods used to notify key government officials and
emergency response organizations.Ø Describes  the methods and warning devices used to disseminate
emergency alerts and warnings to the public for the types of hazards
that threaten the jurisdiction.Ø Identifies types of warning devices (sirens, EAS stations, telephone,
tone alert radios, route aler ting, etc.)used in the jurisdiction and
specifies their location, and the geographic area each device covers.Ø Describes the procedures for warning special locations, such as
schools, hospitals, nursing homes, recreational facilities, major industrial
sites, institutions, and places of public assembly.Ø Describes the special procedures required to warn the hearing -
impaired and non -English speaking groups.Ø Defines the meaning of all warning signals.

Emergency Public Information
Introduction
EPI's Public
The EPI function gives the public accurate, time ly, and  useful information and
instructions throughout the emergency period.The EPI organization initially
focuses on the dissemination of information and instructions to the people at risk
in the community.However, the EPI organization also must deal  with the wider
public's interest and desire to help or seek information.People may call to find
out about loved ones.They may call to offer help, or simply send donations.They may even urge Federal action.Good, timely information can help prevent
overloading a jurisdiction's communications network, its transportation
infrastructure, and its staff.EPI and
Warning  Some jurisdictions use a single annex for warning and EPI.Warning can be
treated as one phase of informing the public, depending  on the hazard.For some hazards (e.g., nuclear power plant accidents), a jurisdiction may have
only a few minutes to alert those at risk.Pre -scripted information must go out
with the initial warning.EPI also follows up with what is happening, what th e
response organization is doing, and  what else the public should do for its safety.For other hazards (e.g., hurricanes), the media can get the public's attention
days in advance.EPI can feed preparedness information into an established

(9/96)  page 5 -D-2
media -public l ink, and give updates to the media and the public after impact.For still other hazards (e.g., an earthquake), there may be no useful warning.

, and give updates to the media and the public after impact.For still other hazards (e.g., an earthquake), there may be no useful warning.

The hazard event itself gets the public's attention, and EPI follows (e.g., after an
earthquake, to help prepar e the public for aftershocks).In this Guide's approach, a warning annex focuses on the specialized system
and procedures the jurisdiction's government uses to learn of imminent danger
and to alert those at risk quickly, before impact.An EPI annex d eals with
developing messages and accurate information for the public, getting the
information out, and monitoring how the information is received throughout the
emergency period.The warning system is one means for an EPI organization to
get information out, and an EPI annex must address coordination with those
responsible for the warning system.EPI and
Media
Relations  For its information and instructions to reach area residents, an EPI organization
must develop ties to all media in --or around --the jur isdiction.These ties usually
carry over from strictly EPI matters (when government has something to say or
show and needs the media to relay it) into news coverage (when the media have
to relay their stories and need government to say or show something).For most
jurisdictions, media relations become a natural extension of the EPI function --all
part of a PIO’s job.When media relations are limited to local media, this usually is not a problem.Local media, like the EPI organization, remain after the eme rgency.They share
concern for the community's welfare, and they answer to the community for the
service they provide.Local media, being sensitive to community needs, can
work with the PIO to focus on strict EPI concerns and attend to news as time
and c ircumstance permit.Media relations become a challenge when the demand for news coverage
overwhelms an EPI organization's ability to perform its basic mission: to provide
timely, accurate, and useful information and instructions to area residents.This
can happen when national media, and many "local" media representatives from
outside the area, converge on the jurisdiction.

This Guide's approach is to treat media relations as a part of the PIO's job
(since the EPI organization needs the media to get i nformation out), and to
Attachment D:  Emergency Public Information
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -D-2
recommend that an EPI annex treat media convergence as a contingency to be
planned for --not as the principal concern of the EPI organization.Developing an EPI Annex
Purpose
An EPI annex describes the means, organization, an d process by which a
jurisdiction will provide timely, accurate, and useful information and instructions
to area residents throughout an emergency.Situation and
Assumptions  This section should describe the planning environment for the EPI function and
show what uncertainties have been treated as fact.Planners might consider the
following:
Situation  Ø General .A situation section should list the hazards that face the
jurisdiction.It should note which types of emergency (if not all) would
require act ivation of the EPI response organization.If a given hazard
requires special planning provisions, the section should mention that
hazard -specific appendices have been developed for the annex.Ø Means of Dissemination .A situation section should give rel evant facts
about the means available to the jurisdiction for transmitting EPI.Relevant facts include:
• Identified Resources .The section should describe the
principal means by which EPI will be disseminated (EAS;
television, radio, and cable outlets no t participating in EAS;
newspapers and specially printed material).A listing of these
should be attached to the annex and address hours of operation
for radio/TV/cable stations, circulation (morning/ evening,
daily/weekly) of newspapers, language covered , and points of
contact (day/night/weekend).The section also should describe
what back -up means can be used (vehicle -mounted public
address systems, door -to-door).• Coverage .The section should describe the area covered by
broadcast stations and give a t least a rough idea of audience
access to cable and newspapers (e.g., number of subscribers).

 a t least a rough idea of audience
access to cable and newspapers (e.g., number of subscribers).

Attachment D:  Emergency P ublic Information
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -D-3
• Vulnerability .The section should note how the means for
disseminating EPI could be harmed by hazards that face the
jurisdiction.(The section can refer ence maps and/or any similar
discussion in the jurisdiction’s Warning Annex.)Contact with
the means of dissemination also should be addressed, if the
jurisdiction relies only on the telephone system.• Dependency .Along with vulnerability, a local EPI ann ex
should note any dependency on out -of-town media (e.g.,
printers and newspapers).Ø Audience .A situation section should give relevant facts about the
audience for EPI.Relevant facts include:
 • Special Needs Groups .The section should list the
jurisdiction's non -English speaking groups in excess of some
planning threshold (e.g., five percent of population) and note the
foreign language media that could be used to communicate with
these groups.It also should note other factors that affect
people's a bility to receive, act on, or understand EPI.These
might include sight or hearing impairments, being in custodial
institutions (e.g., schools, nursing homes, hospitals, etc.), or
being unfamiliar with the area and its hazards (as is the case with
tourist s).• Preparedness .The section may note whether ongoing public
preparedness campaigns are conducted and whether printed
material is  available in telephone books, at key locations, or
from community groups to which it has been distributed.Assumptions  Ø Media .Relevant assumptions about the media include:
• Local Cooperation on  EPI.Local media will cooperate in
placing the community's need for EPI ahead of the need for
news coverage, at least in the initial warning and response phase
Attachment D:  Emergency Public Information
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -D-5
of an emergency.(As appropriate, written agreements for
commercial broadcast media to disseminate EPI may be
prepared.)• External Media Interest .

 -D-5
of an emergency.(As appropriate, written agreements for
commercial broadcast media to disseminate EPI may be
prepared.)• External Media Interest .

Some events, or even forecast
events, can bring many reporters, photographers, and camera
crews to an area;  this will crea te heavy demands on the EPI
organization, requiring augmentation.External media will be
interested less in details than in spectacle and "human interest"
stories of universal appeal and quick impact.Ø Audience .Relevant assumptions about the audience may address:
• Preparedness .The section may note what level of
preparedness is assumed.Public awareness campaigns will not
have been 100 percent effective, especially in jurisdictions with
many touri sts and transients.• Demand for Additional Information .People will want more
information and will call to get it if possible.Concept of
Operations  The concept of operations section provides general information on how EPI is
to be disseminated to the public.It describes policies, protocols, and a
sequence of  activity.General  This section should address who activates the EPI organization, how the
organization is notified, and where personnel should report (e.g., the EOC).It
should set forth priorities for EPI activity:  production and dissemination of EPI,
response to public inquiry, monitoring and rumor control, and media relations.It also should set forth a jurisdiction's policy to have a single release point for
EPI (such as a public inf ormation center), to focus EPI on specific emergency -
related information, and to provide positive and reassuring information when
possible.Phased
Activity  Ø Increased Readiness (e.g., Forecast Event) .Attachment D:  Emergency Public Information

Coordination  The concept of operations section should address how the jurisdiction will
coordinate EPI in order to "speak with one voice."The section should prov ide
for one PIO and alternate, designated by the “CEO,” for dissemination of
official EPI and instructions through the media to the public.It should provide
for management of EPI out of one location.It should provide for coordination
between individual  agencies' public affairs officers and the PIO.It also should
provide for coordination between public affairs officers dispatched to the scene
of event and the central location for EPI (e.g., briefings before the public affairs
officer goes to the scene and regular contact thereafter).

 event and the central location for EPI (e.g., briefings before the public affairs
officer goes to the scene and regular contact thereafter).

Coordination must
include procedures for verifying and authenticating information, and for obtaining
approval to release information.The concept of operations section also should address how the jurisdiction will
deal with media convergence.(This could be by reference to a separate
appendix to the annex.)Provision should be made for possible transfer of some
duties to the Office of the Chief Executive (in jurisdictions where there is a press
secretary, for example),  use of a trained local media person to help with out -of-
town media (where resources are more limited), or obtaining assistance from
Attachment D:  Emergency Public Information
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -D-10
another level of government's public information staff.Provision should be
made for establishing a separate media center,  if EOC briefing space is
inadequate.Provision also should be made for credentialing media
representatives and for coordinating with law enforcement to allow media
access to the scene (if it is safe to do so).The section should make clear who
decides to  implement such provisions.Interjurisdictiona
l Coordination  Local -Local.The concept of operations section should address coordination
between city and county, or between local jurisdictions that rely on the same
media resources.Local -State .Stat e law and plans define the framework for local and State
coordination on EPI.States and localities should consider how they will
coordinate in emergencies with or without a Governor's declaration of
emergency.This may include support for media relation s.
Local -State -Federal .In disasters that threaten to overwhelm a State's
capability to respond and support its local governments, the Federal
Government may be asked to deploy to the affected State under the FRP.The
FRP calls for maximum coordinatio n of agencies' information releases through a
Joint Information Center (JIC) to ensure consistency and accuracy.The JIC is
a single location where the media have access to information and the public
affairs personnel of various agencies can consult with one another.The
resources of the JIC are made available to State, local, and voluntary agencies
so that all levels of government may conduct public information activities
together.

 available to State, local, and voluntary agencies
so that all levels of government may conduct public information activities
together.

This is the best way to ensure that local, State, and Federal officials
are using the same information and are not making inconsistent statements.If a
single local -State -Federal JIC is not a viable option, public affairs personnel,
decision -makers, and news centers are to be connected by electronic mail, fax,
and telephone  in a  "Joint Information System" (JIS).In a JIS, releases of
information should be coordinated to ensure that everyone is using the most
recent and accurate data.Attachment D:  Emergency Public I nformation

Responsibilities  The EPI organization should be depi cted in a chart.The organization may be
built around distinct areas of responsibility (e.g., information gathering and
production, monitoring and rumor control, public inquiries, and media relations).It is not always necessary for each "box" to be fill ed by a different person; it is
necessary to be able to staff each "box" to meet increased demands on the EPI
organization (e.g., for public inquiries or media relations).Charts can reflect
augmentation.See Figure 5 -D-1.The following types of  taskin g may be

Evacuation
Introduction
 This function deals with the movement of people to a safe area, from an area
believed to be at risk, when emergency situations necessitate such action.Developing an Evacuation Annex
Purpose    An evacuation annex descr ibes the provisions that have been made to ensure
the safe and orderly evacuation of people threatened by the hazards the
jurisdiction faces.Situation and
Assumptions
 This section identifies the emergency conditions that could occur and that would
require evacuation.It identifies the areas potentially subject to evacuation
(areas prone to flooding, seismic activity, or wildland fire; areas located near
facilities that use, store, produce, or transport hazardous materials; etc.).Any
site-specific ev acuation plans and maps should be appended to the annex.This
section identifies the population groups requiring special assistance during
evacuation, e.g., the elderly and persons with disabilities.This section also addresses the unknowns of the emerge ncy situation that are
associated with evacuation.

This section also addresses the unknowns of the emerge ncy situation that are
associated with evacuation.

Assumptions made should focus on the probable
operational situations under disaster conditions, cover unanticipated
contingencies, and establish the  parameters within which the planning  for
evacuation wi ll take place.Typical are assumptions that:
Ø The annex focuses on hazards that provide sufficient warning time to
implement a planned evacuation for people identified as being at risk in
the jurisdiction.Ø Spontaneous evacuation will occur when there i s sufficient warning of
the threat.Between 5 and 20 percent of the people at risk will
evacuate before being directed to do so.Ø Some people will refuse to evacuate, regardless of the threat.page 5 -E-1
SLG 101: Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)
 Ø Some owners of companion animals will refuse to evacuate u nless
arrangements have been made to care for their animals.Ø Roughly 20 percent of the population at risk will require shelter in a
mass care facility.(This figure should be adjusted based on any
behavioral studies conducted in the jurisdiction.)Many evacuees will
seek shelter with relatives, friends, or motels rather than use
government -provided mass care facilities.Ø Where available, military support (as approved by the Governor) will
be available to support evacuation efforts.Ø For some seasonal haz ards, such as a hurricane, standard designated
evacuation routes will be used to evacuate people.Ø Evacuation of people at risk for emergency situations that occur with
little or no warning will be implemented on an ad hoc  basis.The
individual responsible  for implementing it should be the IC at the scene
of the emergency, with support arranged through the EOC as
necessary.Evacuation instructions should be based on known or
assumed health risks associated with the hazard.Concept of
Operations    There a re several factors which must be considered when planning for an
evacuation.Among these are the characteristics of the hazard or threat itself.The magnitude, intensity, speed of onset, duration, and impact on the local
community, are all significant el ements to be considered.They will determine
the number of people to be evacuated, time available in which to effect the
evacuation, and the time and distance of travel necessary to insure safety.

the number of people to be evacuated, time available in which to effect the
evacuation, and the time and distance of travel necessary to insure safety.

Evacuees are moved from their homes to a designated area within the
jurisdiction (or a neighboring jurisdiction in some cases) not impacted by the
hazard that caused the evacuation.General  The provisions that have been made for carrying out a complete or partial
evacuation of the people from the jurisdiction are addressed.The areas likely
to be evacuated are defined.The travel routes are specified and the destination
of evacuees is identified.The means that will be used to transport evacuees are
described.The approach for controlling the flow of evacue es from the

threatened area is outlined and the arrangements that have been made to return
evacuees to their homes explained.This section:
 Ø Identifies the scope of authority granted to an IC to act under standing
orders from the “CEO.”
Ø Describes the  provisions that have been made for evacuating special
needs populations.Such populations include: children in school,
children in day care centers, nursing home residents (long -term); the
handicapped (hearing -impaired, sight -impaired, mentally impaired,  and
mobility -impaired); non -English speaking people; institutionalized
individuals (in hospitals, mental health facilities, nursing homes (short -
term)); incarcerated residents (in jails, juvenile facilities, drug treatment
centers, etc.); transient popula tions (street people, motel and hotel
guests, seasonal workers); and people without transportation.Ø Describes the means the government will use to keep evacuees and the
general public informed on evacuation activities and the specific actions
they should take.Ø Describes the evacuation options and the evacuation routes that have
been developed to protect and move the people away from the different
types of hazards the jurisdiction faces.Ø Describes the modes of transportation that will be used to move
evacuees.Ø Identifies assembly areas for picking up people that do not have their
own transportation.Ø Outlines or references the document that details the evacuation
movement control procedures.Ø Describes the provisions that have been made to control access  to the
evacuated area.

Ø Outlines or references the document that details the evacuation

consequences for not evacuating and the services (food, medical,
utilities, sanitation, etc.)that will be discontinued or interrupted in the
evacuation area.Ø Issues evacu ation instructions or an evacuation order when appropriate.Evacuation

Mass Care
Introduction
 This fun ction deals with the actions that are taken to protect evacuees and other
disaster victims from the effects of the disaster.These actions include providing
temporary shelter, food, medical care, clothing, and other essential life support
needs to those p eople that have been displaced from their homes because of a
disaster or disaster threat situation.Developing a Mass Care Annex
Purpose    A mass care annex describes the provisions that have been made to ensure
disaster victims receive the appropri ate services when at a mass care facility.Local government is responsible for the development of a capability to provide
mass care services for its citizens in the event of an emergency and should be
prepared, if necessary, to receive and care for people  evacuated from the area
directly impacted by a disaster.The requirements for services vary depending
upon the nature and phase of the emergency.Local officials must be ready to
provide different types of support in response to the unique nature of the
situation.Prior to onset, facilities (e.g., schools, churches, nonessential
government buildings, etc.)are needed to register, shelter, feed, protect, and
provide for other human needs of an evacuated population.During the
emergency phase, these faci lities may be used to provide evacuees physical
protection from the effects (e.g., water and wind associated with storms,
earthquake aftershocks, radiological contamination from a nuclear power plant
accident, etc.)of a disaster.During the post -disaster  period these facilities may
be used on a long -term basis to feed, care for, and provide temporary housing
to the disaster victims whose homes have been severely damaged or destroyed
or cannot return to their homes because of damage to or debris on roads a nd
bridges.

 homes because of damage to or debris on roads a nd
bridges.

Other long -term post -disaster mass care options may include:
kitchens to feed people; water supply stations; first aid stations; temporary
housing in rental units, tents, hotels/motels, and mobile homes; hygiene facilities
(portable toilets a nd showers); mail service, etc.page 5 -F-1
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  Situation and
Assumptions  This section  should identify the emergency conditions that could occur which
would require the activation of mass care  operations.These considerations,
  in turn, provide input for decisions  about types and locations of mass care
facilities to be supported.For example, if the community is vulnerable to floods,
hurricanes, tornadoes, and nuclear power plant accidents, the locations of the
mass care facilities should be outside of the floodpl ain and have sufficient
structural integrity to provide people physical protection from the effects of high
wind, earthquake aftershocks, and radiological contamination.This section also should address unknowns of the emergency situation that are
associa ted with mass care.Such assumptions focus on the probable operational
situations under disaster conditions, cover unanticipated contingencies, and
establish the parameters within which the planning for mass care will take place.Typical assumptions are t hat:
Ø The ultimate responsibility for mass care services for citizens rests with
local government.Ø A public, nonprofit, or private -sector organization will manage and staff
the jurisdiction's mass care facilities.Ø For a large -scale disaster, a DWI system  will be implemented.Ø In most jurisdictions, the ARC will serve as the principal organization
responsible for operating mass care facilities during disasters.Ø If ARC services are not available locally, other public or nonprofit
organizations in the commu nity will assume responsibility for operating
mass care facilities.These organizations may include such agencies as
the Salvation Army, churches, schools, or local service agencies.Ø Sufficient warning time will be available to ensure that mass care
facilities are opened in time to provide shelter and other services for the
people that have been evacuated.Ø Approximately 80 percent of evacuees will seek shelter with friends or
relatives rather than go to an established mass care facility.

 percent of evacuees will seek shelter with friends or
relatives rather than go to an established mass care facility.

(The actual
figure should be based on behavioral studies and past experience of the
Attachment F:  Mass Ca re
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -F-2
jurisdiction.)Ø Where available, military support (as approved by the Governor) will
be available to support mass care operations.Ø The jurisdiction may have to enter into an agreemen t with adjacent
jurisdictions to arrange for mass care services for evacuees that cannot
be taken care of in the home jurisdiction or to provide similar services
to other jurisdictions when their evacuees cannot be cared for in their
home jurisdiction.Concept of
Operations    This section specifies the conditions under which mass care services will be
provided and describes the methods that will be used to activate and manage
mass care facilities.There are several factors which must be considered when
planning for a mass care operation.Among these are the characteristics of the
hazard or threat itself.The magnitude, intensity, spread of onset, duration, and
impact on the local community, are all significant elements to be considered.They will deter mine the number of people that will need to receive mass care
services.General    The provisions that have been made for setting up, supplying, and operating
mass care facilities are addressed.The areas of the jurisdiction that are likely to
require ev acuation should be identified.The arrangements that have been made
to direct evacuees to specific facilities also should be addressed.This section:
Ø Describes the working relationship the jurisdiction has with the ARC or
other nonprofit, public service , or private -sector organizations that have
responsibility for managing mass care facilities.Ø Identifies the location of all mass care facilities that have been
designated to provide shelter and/or other services to evacuees.Ø Describes the means the gove rnment will use to keep evacuees and the
general public informed on mass care activities.Ø Describes the arrangement for operation of each mass care facility.These include:

medical care, etc.).• Communications proce dures.• Reporting requirements.• Termination of services and closure of the facility.Ø Describes how the mass care function will support efforts to respond to
inquires from family members of disaster victims.• The annex should establish an information f low from mass care
facilities to the Mass Care Coordinator and from the Mass
Care Coordinator to the jurisdiction’s public inquiry response
effort.In this Guide’s approach, that public inquiry response
effort would fall to the EPI organization, which wou ld collect
information from the Mass Care Coordinator and other
sources.• Under the FRP, the ARC and Emergency Support Function 6

responding to inquiries from immediate family members from
outside the affected area about the status of their loved ones.The annex may describe protocols for how a local jurisdiction,

Health and Medical
Introduction
 This fun ction deals with the activities associated with the provision of health and
medical services in emergencies and disasters.For the purposes of this Guide,
health and medical services include: emergency medical (EMS), hospital, public
health, environmental  health, mental health, and mortuary services.

The
activities associated with these services include treatment, transport, and
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning

evacuation of the injured; disposition of the dead; and disease control activities
related to sanitation, preventing contaminati on of water and food supplies, etc.,
during response operations and in the aftermath of a disaster.Depending on
needs and resources, jurisdictions may want to prepare separate annexes for
one or more of these health and medical services.Developing a He alth and Medical Annex
Purpose    A health and medical annex describes policies and procedures for mobilizing
and managing health and medical services under emergency or disaster
conditions.Situation and
Assumptions
  This section provides a general assessment and overview of the jurisdiction’s
existing health and medical capabilities.It focuses on the jurisdiction’s
capability to provide medical care, treatment, and support to victims, response
personnel, and the general public during the response and post -disaster phases.This section also addresses limitations that may degrade health and medical
operations.Assumptions addressed might include the following:
Ø The annex applies primarily to large -scale emergency and disaster
events that would ca use sufficient casualties and/or fatalities to
overwhelm local medical, health, and mortuary services capabilities,
thus requiring maximum coordination and efficient use of these
resources.Ø Public and private medical, health, and mortuary services res ources
located in the jurisdiction will be available for use during disaster
situations.Ø Large -scale emergencies and disaster threat situations (earthquakes,
hurricanes, nuclear power plant accidents, floods, etc.)may affect large
areas of the jurisdicti on, the State, or other States, requiring the use of
mutual aid.Ø Public and private health and medical resources located in the
Attachment G:  Health and Me dical
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning

jurisdiction generally will be available for use during disaster situations,
but many of these resources, including human resou rces, will themselves
be impacted by the disaster.

 situations,
but many of these resources, including human resou rces, will themselves
be impacted by the disaster.

Ø Emergency measures to protect life and health during the first 12 to 24
hours after the disaster in all likelihood will be exclusively dependent
upon local and area resources.Ø Resources available through  area and regional medical, health, and
mortuary services mutual aid agreements will be provided for use during
the disaster situation.Ø It may be necessary to relocate hospital facilities under austere
conditions to contingency field hospitals, or to perm anent or temporary
buildings that will provide patients and medical staff adequate protection
from the effects of the disaster.Ø Volunteers will come forward to help perform essential tasks; their
efforts must be anticipated and coordinated.Concept of
Operations
This section describes how health and medical operations will be conducted in
the jurisdiction and in cooperation with other jurisdictions, other services, and
the State and Federal governments.General    This section details the provisions  for mobilizing and managing health and
medical services.It addresses pre -disaster, disaster, and post -disaster
considerations.It identifies who will be in charge of directing health and medical
operations and provides a general overview on how health a nd medical
activities will be accomplished.Because health and medical services include so many different activities, it is
essential to establish a framework for these services to work together.To
ensure that the necessary planning and coordination are  accomplished prior to
the occurrence of a disaster and to facilitate the management of health and
medical services during disasters, it is essential to vest this planning and
coordination responsibility in one position.An appropriate title for this posi tion
is “Health and Medical Coordinator.”  The individual that fills this position is

(9/96)  page 5 -G-3
responsible for coordinating EMS, hospital, public health, environmental health,
mental health, and mortuary services disaster planning and response actions.The concept  of operations should include provisions for:
Ø Establishment of medical command post at the disaster site(s).Ø Coordinating health and medical response team efforts.Ø Triage of the injured, if appropriate.Ø Medical care and transport for the injured.Ø Identification, transportation, and disposition of the deceased.Ø Holding and treatment areas for the injured.

Resource Management
Introduction
 All responding agencies manage people, equipment, facilities, and supplies to
accomplish their tasks.However, emergencies can require more specialized
resources than the responding agencies have available.The resource
management function is necessary to ensure that:
Ø A complete picture of available resources is known to decision -makers.Ø All available resources are used appropri ately and arrive where and
when they are most needed.Ø Additional resources can be secured for responders as their own
resources are expended or damaged.Ø Critical resource needs of the public are met despite disruption of
commerce and infrastructure.Ø Accountability is maintained for the jurisdiction's use of resources.As presented here, resource management is a process that ranges from
determining needs to finding and staging resources to meet these needs.In
practice, different jurisdictions assign pa rts of this process to several different
organizational elements.The goal of this Guide is not to prescribe an
organizational arrangement, but to suggest all that is involved in resource
management and how the pieces fit together.The Guide is meant to stimulate
ideas, however your jurisdiction organizes to do resource management.Developing a Resource Management Annex
Purpose    A resource management annex describes the means, organization, and process
by which a jurisdiction will find, obtain, a llocate, and distribute resources to
satisfy needs that are generated by an emergency.Attachment H:  Resource Management                                                                        page 5 -H-2

Situation and
Assumptions    The situation and assumptions section describes the planning environment for
the resource management function, i.e., factors that direc tly impact the ability of
the jurisdiction to satisfy resource demand and manage support activities during
response operations.

  The situation and assumptions section describes the planning environment for
the resource management function, i.e., factors that direc tly impact the ability of
the jurisdiction to satisfy resource demand and manage support activities during
response operations.

Factors to be considered include:
Situation
Ø Hazards .The situation and assumptions section should outline the
potential fo r emergencies requiring the resource management function.In particular, the section could highlight potential critical resource
shortages (e.g., power, fuel in winter,  potable water in times of drought
or as a secondary effect of heavy flooding) and cre dible emergency
scenarios that would deplete responding agencies' resources.Possible
effects on the transportation and distribution network also should be
noted.Ø Resources .Complete listings of resources and planned requirements
should be maintained i n attachments to the plan, a resource
manual/database, or in organizational SOPs, as appropriate.However,
the situation section can summarize the jurisdiction's status for general
resource categories, such as:
• Personnel (including skilled labor and profe ssionals).• Communications equipment.• Vehicles for passengers, cargo, and debris removal (e.g., dump
trucks and garbage trucks).• Heavy equipment for public works applications (e.g., cranes,
road graders, etc.)and materials handling (e.g., fork li fts,
conveyor belts).• Pumps.• Useful materials and tools such as fuel, sand and sandbags,
plastic sheeting (for roof repair, etc.), shovels, picks, chainsaws,
hatchets, etc.Attachment H:  Resource Management
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -H-3
• Mass care supplies such as medicine and first aid supplies;
potable water; foo d; bedding, blankets, and cots; sanitation
supplies (e.g., portable toilets), lighting (lanterns, candles, etc.).• Portable generators.Ø Mutual Aid.The situation and  assumptions section can also note the
jurisdiction's participation in mutual aid agre ements.Assumptions    Assumptions might include the following:
Ø Information .A resource inventory or database will be maintained by
the Emergency Manager or the Resource Manager.Ø Initial sustainability .Response agencies will sustain themselves durin g
the first 24 hours of an emergency.Households and businesses located
in the area directly affected by the emergency situation will sustain
themselves during the first 72 hours of an emergency.

 Initial sustainability .Response agencies will sustain themselves durin g
the first 24 hours of an emergency.Households and businesses located
in the area directly affected by the emergency situation will sustain
themselves during the first 72 hours of an emergency.

(An ongoing
public information activity will help ensure that the population knows
what to include in a disaster supply kit.)Ø Evacuee Support .Evacuees located in a mass care facility will receive
necessary life sustaining services from the facility.Ø Donations .A resource management annex should acknowledge t he
potential for donations, given any emergency --even a forecast
emergency -- that generates sustained media coverage.Ø Availability of volunteers .Performance of the resource management
function will depend on the availability of a large pool of volunteers.Offers of help will be received.Ø Access to Mutual Aid .If the jurisdiction is depending on mutual aid to
cover resource shortfalls, it assumes some parties to the agreement will
themselves be affected and unable to provide the resources.Ø Availability of aid from a higher level of government .Pressure on
the resource management function to supply unmet needs of response
Attachment H:  Resource Management
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -H-4
agencies may be reduced by assistance from the next higher level of
government.(However, the resource management functi on will still be
necessary given uncertainty over the timing, form, and amount of that
assistance relative to the jurisdiction's needs.Resource management
planning is also necessary to generate detailed information on needs and
logistics that the higher level of government may not have.)Concept of
Operations    This section should describe how the resource management organization will be
activated and the sequence of tasks it will perform.It also should set forth
resource management policie s (if these are not described in a separate
“Policies” section ).General
Sequence of
Activities
 General policies might include:
Ø Priorities .Disaster victims will take precedence in the allocation of
resources.Specific prioritie s will be set by the Resource Manager  in
consultation with the “CEO” or a designated official in the EOC.Ø Initial sustainability .Response agencies will sustain themselves during
the first 24 hours of an emergency.Ø Supplier of last resort .Emergency services agencies should exhaust
their own channels of support (e.g., mutual aid agreements with similar
agencies in other jurisdictions) before turning to the resource
management function.Ø Costs .

 resort .Emergency services agencies should exhaust
their own channels of support (e.g., mutual aid agreements with similar
agencies in other jurisdictions) before turning to the resource
management function.Ø Costs .

Purchase prices and contract costs, where possible, shoul d be
established during development of the EOP.Even if eligible for
reimbursement, costs should initially be considered the responsibility of
the requesting agency.Ø Notification .The Resource Manager  should be among those initially
notified of an emerg ency.When warning is available, suppliers with
whom agreements exist should be notified of the intent to activate the
agreements.Ø Activation and deployment .The annex should specify who (the
“CEO” or the Emergency Manager) activates the resource manage ment
Attachment H:  Resource Management
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -H-5
function.It also should specify the core cadre of staff that will perform
the function at the EOC, regardless of the scope of the activation.The
Resource Manager 's discretion and authority to activate additional
facilities and personnel --for examp le, a Donations Coordination Team
and associated telephone banks, donations receiving areas,
checkpoints, and warehouses --should be indicated.(A complete
breakout of the staffing requirements at each possible facility is
appropriate as a tab to the Admin istration and Logistics section, but
could be referenced here.)Ø Emergency activity .The  concept of operations should address four
basic concerns of emergency resource management activity: determining
needs, obtaining supplies, maintaining financial and legal accountability,
and distributing supplies.See Figure 5 -H-1.• Determining needs .− Needs assessment (ongoing) .The annex should
explain how needs known in the field will become
known to the resource management organization.At
first, thi s may be a matter of anticipating needs based on
preliminary damage assessments and past experience.The Resource Manager  should relay to the resource
management organization all needs determined by the
“CEO.”  All agencies should be tasked to report to
resource management --whether directly or through the
EOC Manager --any needs they are unable to meet
through their own channels as the emergency
progresses.For its part, the resource management
organization must ensure that it extracts the essential
inform ation from those who report a need.


organization must ensure that it extracts the essential
inform ation from those who report a need.

Essential
information includes:
∗ WHAT is needed and WHY, as specifically as
possible (since a different item might work as
well or better and be readily available).∗ HOW MUCH is needed.∗ WHO n eeds it.Attachment H:  Resource Management
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -H-6
∗ WHERE it is needed.∗ WHEN it is needed.− Prioritization (ongoing) .The Resource Manager
will apprise "the Needs Group " of priorities set by the
“CEO” or a designated representative.A formal
classification system may be useful.Note that among
the highest priorities may be satisfying needs of the
resource management organization, e.g., securing the
use of any additional facilities required by the Resource
Manager.− Follow -up.Resource requests should be logged,
prioritized, passed on to those res ponsible for obtaining
and committing resources, and then tracked (as
Pending, En Route, Met, etc.)via subsequent feedback
from "the Supply Group ," "the Distribution Group ,"
and the requesting party.The Resource Manager
should receive reports on a regula r basis about needs
and the status of requests.• Obtaining Supplies .− Notification of suppliers .When warning is available,
the Supply Group  should notify suppliers with whom
agreements exist of the jurisdiction's intent to activate
the agreement.Avai lability of supplies should be
validated and key items should be reserved.− Evaluation of requests against known supplies
(ongoing) .Upon receipt of a request, the Supply
Group  should attempt to fill the need with jurisdictional
resources or resources f or which agreements are in
place.If the needed resource is on hand, the Supply
Group  contacts the supplier, confirms transportation
responsibilities and provides necessary information
(e.g., to pass checkpoints), notifies the Distribution
Attachment H:  Resource Management
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -H-6
Group  of the i ncoming resource (or of the need to pick
it up) and its priority, and informs the Needs Group
that action has been taken on the request.

 the i ncoming resource (or of the need to pick
it up) and its priority, and informs the Needs Group
that action has been taken on the request.

If the needed
resource is not listed among prearranged supplies, the
next step is to see if a workable offer to donate  it has
been made (assuming a Donations Coordination Team
has been activated).If not, the options are to procure
(or hire) or to solicit a donation of the needed resource.Attachment H:  Resource Management
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -H-7
 − Procurement and Hiring .When requests are of high
priority for the jurisdictio n, an expedited procurement
or hiring process may be in order.Procurement involves
contacting suppliers, negotiating terms (in coordination
with the Financial Officer  and Legal Advisor  if
necessary), making transportation arrangements,
notifying the Distr ibution Group , and notifying the
Needs Group  of action taken.Hiring can take
advantage of local or State job service records and
personnel, any "applicant supply files" the government
personnel office maintains for particular types of
positions, etc., i n order to fill positions.− Soliciting Donations .When high priority needs cannot
be satisfied quickly through procurement and hiring, or
when cost begins to outweigh time as a consideration,
an appeal can be made through a Donations
Coordination Team and the PIO for donations of the
goods or service in question.See the National
Donations Steering Committee's Donations
Management Guidance Manual .• Maintaining financial and legal accountability .The
Finance Officer  should keep the Resource Manager  and the
Supply Group  aware of their authorized budget, log and
process transactions, track accounts, and secure access to
more funding as necessary and feasible (e.g., ensuring
jurisdictional access to cash donations, where law permits).The
Legal Advisor  sho uld keep them aware of their legal
obligations --and also of any special powers granted by law to
expedite their tasks.• Distributing goods (and services) .− Activating and operating key facilities .

The
Resource Manager  should determine what facilities
(e.g., donations receiving areas, checkpoints,
Attachment H:  Resource Management
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -H-8
warehouses) will be required to handle the flow of
resources into and through the jurisdiction.The
Resource Manager  should then direct the
Distribution Group  to set up and operate the facilities.− Traffic con trol.The Distribution Group  should
ensure that high priority resources are dispatched
quickly to where they need to be.Unnecessary traffic
should be held back or rerouted.− Hauling .Procurement and donations efforts should try
to ensure that sup pliers of a resource also supply
transportation for it: the jurisdiction's transportation
resources may be almost fully committed.However,
the Distribution Group  may be tasked to pick up
resources.− Reporting and coordination .From the EOC, the
Distribu tion Group  would notify checkpoints and
other facilities (as applicable) of incoming resources to
expect, as well as their priority designation.Checkpoints and other facilities (as applicable) would
provide regular reports on resources passing through
(or inventory), allowing the Distribution Group  to
track location of resources and timeliness of delivery.Ø Post-emergency activity (recovery)   When needs have largely been
met, the crisis subsides, and the jurisdiction's government can begin to
function i n its normal, day -to-day mode, the resource management
function will have to address four areas:
• Disposal of excess stocks .Loaned equipment will have to be
returned to its owners.Surplus property can be dealt with
through normal procedures --except per haps where hazardous
materials are concerned.Warehouse space may be needed for
excess donations as local and area volunteer agencies attempt
to absorb them; a Donations Coordination Team would then
Attachment H:  Resource Management
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -H-9
have a role in finding takers for the excess.• Stand down .Facilities and staff should be deactivated as soon
as is feasible, with all reports and documentation filed.• Financial settlement .


have a role in finding takers for the excess.• Stand down .Facilities and staff should be deactivated as soon
as is feasible, with all reports and documentation filed.• Financial settlement .

The jurisdiction may need to reimburse
or compensate the owners of private property.It may also
have to submit re quired reports that address the jurisdiction's
financial liability for any assistance received under the Stafford
Act.• Thank -you's .Suppliers and donors who came through for the
jurisdiction should receive some acknowledgment, as feasible
and in coordina tion with the Office of the Chief Executive and
the PIO.New suppliers might be polled about their interest in
developing a memorandum of agreement in time for the next
emergency.Coordination
with Voluntary
Agencies  A resource management annex should a ddress how the jurisdiction's
government will coordinate its resource management activities with voluntary
agencies' own donations management efforts.It also should address policies on
use of volunteer labor.Local, State,
and Federal
Coord ination    The resource management annex should describe what relationship, if any, the
resource management function has to the resource support efforts of the next
higher level of government.For example, State donations management planning
should recogniz e that an 800 number and technical assistance are available
through FEMA upon request.Organization
and Assignment
of
Responsibilities  The organizational scheme used here (see Figure 5 -H-1, next page) is
conceptual.It was meant to reflect the process of resource management
activity: determine needs, find a source for meeting the needs, ensure financial
and legal accountability, and transport and distribute the resources.It should
be adapted to conditions in the jurisdiction.For example, in some lo cal
jurisdictions one person may receive and log requests, determine resource
availability, and initiate procurement actions if needed.They may leave
donations management work to voluntary agencies or a State Donations
Attachment H:  Resource Management

(9/96)  page 5 -H-10

 (Those jurisdictions opting to treat donations management separately should
recognize and structure the links between it and the resource management
function.Both functions will rely on the jurisdiction's t ransportation, distribution,
and traffic control systems.Each will need access to the other's information
regarding needs and supply:  donations management can supplement resource
management's efforts to obtain certain items and also should relay useful bids
from the contractors and vendors that inevitably call donations hotlines; at the
same time, donations management may be unsuccessful in filling some identified
needs by a certain time, making procurement through resource management
necessary.)The f ollowing types of tasking should be performed for resource management,

Administration
and Logistics   This section addresses the administrative a nd general support requirements for
carrying out resource management tasking.Administration
  The following specific areas should be addressed:
Reports and records .The annex should address what kinds of records must be
kept, for how long, in what for m (e.g., hard copy or database); what
reports should be made, from whom to whom, in what format; and how
records vital to operations will be protected.(Note: Hard copy
"resource manuals" are useful, but where possible jurisdictions should
take advantage of the search
and sorting capacities of a computer database in maintaining the resource
inventory.)Ø Finance .The annex should address the jurisdiction's financial policies,
e.g., regarding use of funds already appropriated and how contingency
funds  will be made available.Ø Procurement .The annex should note the jurisdiction's policies on
Attachment H :  Resource Management
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -H-17
emergency procurement.Ø Hiring and Other Personnel Issues .The annex should note waivers
of normal procedure for matters of hiring, assigning work that is not  in
an employee's job description or at an employee's normal duty station,
and the like.Logistics   The following specific areas should be addressed:
Ø Staffing .• Core Cadre .The annex should identify by position what staff
will be required to perform the resource management function,
regardless of the nature or scope of the emergency.• Maximum Complement .The annex also should set forth an
estimate , based on the kinds and number of facilities that would
be activated, of the maximum number of personnel that would
be needed to support the resource management function.A
breakdown by facility would be useful.• Augmentation .The annex should indicate  the means the
jurisdiction will use to meet a staffing shortfall in the resource
management function, be it reassignment of jurisdictional
personnel, aid from other jurisdictions, area volunteers, or use
of the National Guard.Ø Facilities .• Minimum .

 Minimum .

The annex should spell out where basic resource
management activities will be conducted, if locations other than
the EOC are involved (e.g., if procurement activity will be
conducted from the Department of General Services, with
communications links to the EOC).• With significant influx of aid expected .The Resource
Manager may direct that other facilities be activated, such as the
Attachment H:  Resource Management
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 5 -H-18
following:
 − Point of Arrival .The FRP refers to the "point of
arrival" as "the designated loc ation (typically an airport)
within or near the disaster -affected area where newly -
arriving staff, supplies, and equipment are initially
directed."While meant for States expecting Federal
resources, this FRP concept is a useful planning
consideration for  any jurisdiction that could expect to
receive significant mutual aid: some idea must be had of
where to report first.− Mobilization Centers .A mobilization center is a
designated location for receiving and processing
resources and personnel prior to the ir deployment to a
staging area or incident site.It may coincide with the
point of arrival.For arriving personnel, the mobilization
center may have to provide briefings, billeting, and
feeding.Local jurisdictions should identify potential
mobilizatio n centers.− Staging Areas .At staging areas, personnel and
equipment are assembled for immediate deployment to
an operational site in the affected area.Local
jurisdictions should identify potential staging areas;
options include fairgrounds and academi c facilities.− Warehouses and other storage facilities .Aid from
governmental sources should not exceed the capacity of
mobilization centers, staging areas, the incident site, and
the jurisdiction's agencies to absorb it.However, the
jurisdiction may w ish to make arrangements with
realtors to provide a regular update on warehouse
availability.Alternatives include making arrangements
with military installations and neighboring jurisdictions to
assist with any logistical excess.• With extensive do nations expected .

At the State level, the
Attachment H:  Resource Management
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planni ng
(9/96)  page 5 -H-19
Resource Manager and/or Donations Coordinator may require
the following facilities to handle donations, as discussed in the
Donations Management Guidance Manual .Local
jurisdictions should consult the State on ho w best to support the
State donations management framework; however, large
jurisdictions may wish to make similar provisions for handling
donations within the jurisdiction.− Donations Coordination Center/Telephone Bank .At
a Donations Coordination Cen ter, representatives of the
jurisdiction's government and volunteer agencies screen
unsolicited donations offers and match them with
possible recipient organizations.States choosing to
activate an 800 telephone number might set up the
telephone bank at th is facility.− Checkpoints .Checkpoints permit inspection,
scheduling, and (re)routing of inbound trucks and other
vehicles bearing donations.At the State level, potential
locations include weigh stations and rest areas.− Donations Receiving Area(s) .A donations receiving
area serves as a collection point and sorting area for
unsolicited donations of goods.It should be located as
close to air, water, and rail transport facilities as is
feasible outside the disaster area.Other considerations
include p arking (for the large number of workers
required), covered storage space, and ample room for
trucks to maneuver.State fairgrounds have been used
as donations receiving areas.Since fairgrounds also
have been suggested as prime locations for staging
areas , it should be noted again that jurisdictions must
coordinate the logistical demands of donations
management with those of the entire resource
management system.(Note: Some people in donations
refer to this facility as a “reception center”; however,
that could cause confusion with the use of the same

term in evacuation.)− Warehouses .Where possible, the donations effort
should rely on volunteer agencies' warehousing
capacity.

20
term in evacuation.)− Warehouses .Where possible, the donations effort
should rely on volunteer agencies' warehousing
capacity.

However, should additional space be
necessary --particularly when disposal of donations
becomes difficult --the jurisdiction should have on hand
information from realtors or a real estate board to
locate suitable warehousing space.− Distribution Centers .Goods are distributed directly
to victims at distribution centers.Churches  and
volunteer agencies' facilities are good locations.In
Federally declared disasters, distribution centers and
Disaster Recovery Centers (DRC) can be collocated or
fairly near one another to allow comprehensive service
delivery to the affected populace.• Lodging .An influx of volunteers and government workers
creates a need for billeting.Provision should be made for this at
points of arrival, mobilization centers, and even donations
receiving areas; the space can be reclaimed for other purposes
if sufficient hotel, church, or school gym space just outside of
the affected area is available
Ø Communications .As a potentially far -flung enterprise, resource
management depends on communications.The number of telephone
lines, fax machines, and other standa rd equipment required will depend
on the anticipated size of the jurisdiction's resource management
operation.Special considerations include data modems for a State
Donations Coordination Center (to receive information from the national
database), a 1 -800 trunk line for a State Donations Coordination
Center (to receive calls), citizens band radio and dispatching for
communicating with trucks, and internal communications systems for
warehouses (such as walkie -talkies or a public address system).Ø Computer s and software .Resource management involves large
amounts of information best handled with databases (resource listings)
Attachment H:  Resource Management
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planni ng
(9/96)  page 5 -H-21
and spreadsheet programs (financial management, inventory control).Reports will require a word processing program.Ø Office equipment and supplies .Ø Forms .Where hard copy forms are used, each facility should have a
sufficient supply on hand from the start (e.g., in a "go kit").Including the
forms in the EOP also permits reproduction, if photocopiers are
availabl e.

Plan
Development
and
Maintenance   Ø Transportation .The annex should discuss what transportation
resources are available for resource management.

Much ongoing activity is necessary to support the resource management
function, including: conductin g planning meetings; updating resource listings;
monitoring potential resource crises; developing and negotiating standard
contracts and leases, memoranda of understanding, and mutual aid agreements;
developing ready -to-use public information materials (or  at least templates);
writing and refining SOPs; training; and exercising the function.Responsibility
for this activity should be assigned in this section.The Emergency Manager should have responsibility for calling planning meetings
on advice f rom the Resource Manager, who should determine how often to
hold meetings.Meeting organizers should strive to include representatives from
groups such as private industry, professional and labor associations, volunteer
groups, and the media (at least whe n donations are an issue).The annex may specify what triggers the need to revise the annex, including plan
review, exercise results, post -event critiques, changes in the hazard situation, or
the incorporation of new players and new technology.Authori ties

 Chapter 6
Hazard -Unique Planning Considerations
Introduct ion
 This chapter provides guidance for developing hazard -specific appendices.Hazard -specific appendices offer a means of extending functional annexes to
address special and unique response procedures, notifications, protective
actions, emergency publi c information, and other needs generated by a
particular hazard.They allow the jurisdiction, in its EOP, to address priorities
identified through hazard analysis and to meet detailed regulatory requirements
associated with some hazards.A hazard -specifi c appendix should be prepared
for any functional annex that does not, by itself, give enough information to
perform the function adequately in the face of a particular high -priority hazard.Some hazards may require that appendices be prepared for various f unctional
annexes; others may affect planning for only one or two functions.Appendices
may be long or very brief depending upon need.Think of hazard -specific appendices as  supplements  to functional annexes.Planning considerations common to all h azards should be addressed in
functional annexes, not repeated in hazard -specific appendices.Development of a Hazard -Specific Appendix
 The decision to develop a hazard -specific appendix should be based on special
planning requirements not common to  other hazards addressed in the functional
annex, and on regulatory considerations that may require extensive, detailed
planning that is inappropriate for inclusion in the annex.As the planning team develops each of the functional annexes, close scrutiny
must be given to the "unique" characteristics of those hazards that require
special attention.Further, the planning team must know the regulatory
requirements associated with the hazards their jurisdiction faces.This approach promotes consistency and  continuity and provides the flexibility
to include a hazard -specific appendix or not, based on the need to cover
information that is relevant to the hazard, but is not appropriate for inclusion in
the functional annex.Chapter 6:  Hazard -Unique Planning Considerations

 of a Hazard -Specific Append ix
 The content of a hazard -specific appendix focuses on the special planning needs
generated by the hazard and should not duplicate the information in the
functional annex.

The  appendix contains unique and regulatory response
planning details that a pply to a single hazard.It addresses the essential
operational actions that must be accomplished to facilitate the successful
completion of a particular response function.As appropriate, the appendix
should quantify the risk area, geography, and demogr aphy considerations that
apply to the hazard.It is recommended that hazard -specific appendices follow the same structure --
i.e., include, as appropriate, the same content sections (Purpose, Situation and
Assumptions, Concept of Operations, Organization an d Assignment of
Responsibilities, Administration and Logistics, Plan Development, and
Authorities and References) --as the functional annexes.Tabs may be used to: identify hazard -specific risk areas and evacuation routes;
specify provisions and protocol s for warning the public and disseminating
emergency public information; and specify the types of protective equipment
and detection devices for responders, etc.Tabs serve as work aids, and
include such things as maps, charts, tables, checklists, resourc e inventories, and
summaries of critical information.The responsibility for making the decision on what to include in a hazard -
specific appendix is vested with the jurisdiction's planning team.The flexibility
of the planning approach described in thi s Guide should make it possible to
accommodate and satisfy:
Ø The planning requirements associated with unique aspects of hazards
and with various regulatory authorities.Ø The different constituencies in the jurisdiction's emergency response
organizations.Ø The members of the planning team.Chapter 6:  Hazard -Unique Planning Considerations

Table 6 -1 identifies the core functional annexes discussed in Chapter 5, and
provides a synopsis of the typical hazard -specific planning considerations that
are associated with them.The planning team should consider  Table 6 -1
 when making its  decision on the kinds of information to be included in the
appendices that they deem it is appropriate to prepare.Description of Unique and Regulatory Planning Considerations

 significant hazards that
threaten many communities in the United States.

The information provided on
each of these hazards focuses on the specific types of planning considerations
that should be examined, analyzed, and applied, as appropriate, in  the
development of hazard -specific appendices.The format for each attachment
has been structured to be consistent with the planning considerations outlined
above.Please note that what follows is only summary information.Information
on other hazards y our jurisdiction faces and additional relevant data on the
hazards addressed in this chapter should be readily available to the planning
team.Much of the needed information should have been gathered as part of the
jurisdiction's hazard analysis.For add itional information, the planner should
review the applicable hazard -specific planning guides  and other relevant
technical manuals to gain more insight into the hazards and to obtain detailed
information on the emergency response planning considerations as sociated with
each one.SLG 101:   Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning

Attachment A
Earthquake
The Hazard
Nature of the
Hazard  A sudden, violent shaking or movement of part of the earth's surface caused by
the abrupt displacement of rock masses, usually within the upper 10 to 20 miles
of the earth's surface.The earthquake hazard may consist of:
Ground
Motion
 Vibration and shaking of the ground during an earthquake is the most far -
reaching effect and causes the most damage to buildings, structures, lifelines,
etc.Ground
Surface Fault
Rupture    The ground shaking is the result of a rupture of a fault beneath the surface.When the ground shaking results in a rupture of the surface of ground, an
opening of up to 20 feet may occur.Liquefaction  The ground temporarily loses its stre ngth and behaves as a viscous fluid (similar
to quicksand) rather than a solid.Landslides
   Sometimes an earthquake causes a landslide to occur.This involves a rock fall
and slides of rock fragments on steep slopes.Tsunamis  Tsunamis are sea waves  produced by an undersea earthquake.These sea
waves caused by the earthquake can reach 80 feet and can devastate coastal
cities and low -lying coastal areas.Secondary
Hazards  Consequences of earthquakes may include fire, HAZMAT release, or dam
failure, among others.

 and can devastate coastal
cities and low -lying coastal areas.Secondary
Hazards  Consequences of earthquakes may include fire, HAZMAT release, or dam
failure, among others.

Risk Area
 Wide areas of the United States have some vulnerability to earthquakes.Thirty -
nine States face the threat of a major damaging earthquake and are considered
to be earthquake hazard areas.The planning team in each of th e jurisdictions in
these States should use information from their State's earthquake hazard
identification study to quantify the seismic hazard their community faces.This
study addresses the magnitude, estimates the amount of ground shaking that
Attachment A:  Earthquake
SLG 101:   Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -A-2
could oc cur, and delineates the associated geological hazards (landslide,
liquefaction, etc.)that may occur as a result of a catastrophic earthquake.Further, a vulnerability assessment should have been prepared as part of the
hazard analysis.The assessment pro vides the planning team information related
to probable consequences and damages their jurisdiction may suffer if struck by
an earthquake.It focuses on casualties and injuries; potential building losses
and identifies the buildings most vulnerable to sei smicity (including critical
facilities such as hospitals, EOCs, mass care centers, emergency services
organizations' work centers, water and waste management plants, power
companies, etc.); medical needs versus available medical resources; loss of
utilitie s and replacement/repair time; etc.caused by the earthquake and the
collateral hazards it may trigger (e.g.fires, dam or levee failure, tsunamis,
HAZMAT spills, etc.).This information will help the team develop the
appropriate information for inclusion  in the EOP.Earthquake Unique Planning Considerations
 This section contains a listing of the functional annexes that typically would
require the preparation of a hazard -specific appendix for earthquakes.It also
identifies the unique and/or regu latory planning considerations that should be
examined by the planning team and used, as appropriate, when preparing
earthquake -specific appendices.Direction and
Control
 For this hazard it is essential for emergency response personnel to take
immediate  action to gather damage assessment information.This information is
needed to determine the severity and extent of injuries and damages.

 the severity and extent of injuries and damages.

Further,
this data gathering effort should provide much of the information decision
makers will need to implement an d prioritize response actions for:  US&R
activities, access control and re -entry to the impacted area, debris clearance,
restoration of utilities and lifeline repairs, and the inspection, condemnation, and
or demolition of buildings and other structures.Therefore, provisions should be made, as appropriate, to address the following
planning considerations in one or more appendices to a direction and control
annex:
Damage Conduct of ground and aerial surveys to determine the scope of the dam age,
Attachment A:  Earthquake
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning    (3/96)  page 6 -A-2
Assessment
 casualties, and the status of key facilities.Search and
Rescue
 Removal of trapped and injured persons from landslides, buildings collapses,
and other structural collapses, administering first aid, and assisting in
transporting the seriously inj ured to medical facilities.This activity involves the
use of professional and volunteer search teams including the use of dog teams.Consideration should be given to:
Ø Use of damage assessment information to identify the facilities and areas
where US&R operations are to be conducted and to establish a priority
for conduct of these operations.Ø Request for Federal assistance to perform US&R operations.Major consequences associated with an earthquake are the collapse of
buildings and other structures, an d landslides.In a metropolitan area that is
struck by a major earthquake many hundreds to thousands of people could be
trapped.These trapped people need immediate assistance.In such situations,
it is likely that local and State governments would be o verwhelmed by the
demand for emergency services.Further, most jurisdictions do not have a
sufficient quantity of specialized equipment or enough trained teams available to
accomplish the large -scale search and rescue operations that would be needed
to re spond to a catastrophic earthquake.In order to assist State and local
governments to accomplish this critical lifesaving activity, the Federal
Government has established Federal US&R teams.These teams are available
to State and local jurisdictions upon  request.The FRP’s ESF -9 includes
provisions for deploying Federal US&R teams.

 upon  request.The FRP’s ESF -9 includes
provisions for deploying Federal US&R teams.

These teams augment State
and local emergency response efforts to locate, extract, and provide for the
immediate medical treatment of victims trapped in collapsed structures.Access
Control and
Re-Entry
 This section deals with the immediate actions to be taken, as soon as conditions
permit, in the area that was severely impacted by an earthquake.Relevant
considerations include:
Ø Control of access to the area until it is s afe.Only those people directly
involved in emergency response operations should be allowed to enter.Attachment A:  Earthquake
SLG 1 -XX:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning    (3/96)  page 6 -A-3
Ø Establishing a protocol for determining the appropriate time to allow
evacuees and the general public to re -enter the area that was severely
impacted.Debris
Clearance
 The identification, removal, and disposal of rubble, landslides, wreckage, and
other material which block or hamper the performance of emergency response
functions should be a high priority action.Activities may include:
Ø Demolitio n and other actions to clear obstructed roads.Ø Repair or temporary reinforcement of roads and bridges.Ø Construction of emergency detours and access roads.Inspection,
Condemnation
, Demolition
 Inspection of buildings and other structures to determ ine whether it is safe to
inhabit or use them after an earthquake has occurred.Activities may include:
Ø Inspection of buildings and structures which are critical to emergency
services operations and mass care activities.Designate those that may
be occu pied and identify/mark those that are unsafe.Ø Inspection of buildings and structures that may threaten public safety.Identify/mark those that are unsafe and may not be occupied.Ø Inspection of dams and levees.Ø Inspection of less critical damaged struct ures.Designate those that may
be occupied and identify/mark those that are unsafe to occupy.Ø Arrangements for the demolition of condemned structures.Utilities and
Lifeline
Repairs
 Restoration and repair of electrical power, natural gas, water, sew er, and
telephone and other communications systems to minimize the impact on critical
services and the public.Warning  Earthquakes usually occur without warning.Although some earthquakes have
been successfully predicted, a reliable warning system has n ot been developed.

issuance of a tsunami warning.Emergency
Public
Information
 The flow of accurate and timely emergency information is critical to the
protection of lives and property in the wake of a catastrophic earthquake.This
section deals with the provisions th at should be included in the plan for the
preparation and dissemination of notifications, updates, warnings, and
instructional messages.The following planning considerations should be
examined and addressed, if appropriate, in one or more appendices to a n EPI
annex:
Ø Survival tips for people on what to do during and immediately after an
earthquake.Ø Warnings and advice on the continuing threat of fire, unsafe areas,
building collapse, aftershocks, and other hazards.Evacuation  Immediately following an earthquake people may need to be evacuated.People
should be evacuated from structures that have been damaged and are likely to
receive more damage when hit by one or more of the aftershocks.An appendix
to an evacuation annex should address special provi sions for moving the
residents of custodial facilities (hospitals, jails, mental health facilities, nursing
homes, retirement homes, etc.)following an earthquake.Mass Care
 The information gained from the vulnerability assessment should be used to
ensure the following needs are addressed, if appropriate, in one or more
appendices to a mass care annex:
Safe Location
of Facilities    If possible, identify mass care facilities in low seismic risk areas that are also out
of the way of secondary effect thr eats (e.g., flooding from a damaged dam).

Structural
Safety    If the facilities selected for use are located within the earthquake hazard area,
ensure that a structural engineer, knowledgeable of the earthquake hazard:
Ø Identifies facilities for use that  are structurally sound, well retrofitted or

built to code.Ø Ranks the facilities based on the amount of earthquake resistance/
protection each one offers.SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)   page 6 -B-1
Attachment B
Flooding and Dam Failure
The Hazard
Nature of the
Hazard  Flooding o ccurs when normally dry land is inundated with water (or flowing
mud).Flooding may result from: bodies of water overflowing their banks,
including artificial ones like dams and levees; structural failure of dams and
levees; rapid accumulation of runoff o r surface water; hurricane -caused storm
surges or earthquake -caused tsunamis; or erosion of a shoreline.(Coastal
flooding and erosion are not treated in this attachment.)Typically, the two
parameters of most concern for flood planning are suddenness of onset --in the
case of flash floods and dam failures --and flood elevation in relation to
topography and structures.Other factors contributing to damage are the
velocity or "energy" of moving water, the debris carried by the water, and
extended duration of  flood conditions.Flooding can happen at any time of the
year, but predominates in the late Winter and early Spring due to melting snow,
breakaway ice jams, and rainy weather patterns.Risk Area
 All States and territories are at risk from flooding.Apart from a rainy climate,
local risk factors, usually present in combination, include:
Rivers,
Streams, and
Drainageways
  These are bodies of water often subject to overflowing.The size of the stream
can be misleading; small streams that receive su bstantial rain or snowmelt,
locally or upstream, can overflow their banks.High -velocity, low elevation
flooding can be dangerous and damaging.

stantial rain or snowmelt,
locally or upstream, can overflow their banks.High -velocity, low elevation
flooding can be dangerous and damaging.

Six inches of moving water can
knock a person off his or her feet; 12 inches of water flowing at 10 miles per
hour carries the force of a 100 mile -per-hour wind, although the force would be
distributed differently on obstacles.Dams and
Levees
 There are 74,053 dams in the United States, according to the 1993 -1994
National Inventory of Dams.Approximately one third of these pose a "high" or
"significant" hazard to life and property if failure occurs.Structural failure of
dams or levees creates additional problems of water velocity and debris.Attachment B:  Flooding and Dam Failure
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)   page 6 -B-2
Steep
Topography
 Steep topography increases runoff water vel ocity and debris flow.Lack of
vegetation to slow runoff is another factor.Alluvial fans, making up twenty to
thirty percent of the Southwest region, show these characteristics and face the
additional complication of shifting drainage patterns and erosi on.Cold Climatic
Conditions
 Apart from snowmelt, 35 northern States face flooding problems associated
with ice jams.In the Spring, ice breaks away and then collects at constriction
points in rivers and streams (i.e., bends, shallows, areas of dec reasing slope,
and bridges); by trapping water behind it and then later giving way, an ice jam
heightens flood levels both upstream and downstream.Ice jams occur in the
Fall with "frazil ice" (when a swift current permits formation of ice cover, but ice
is carried downstream and attaches to the underside of ice cover there) and in
Winter when channels freeze solid.Identifying
Hazards
 A jurisdiction's susceptibility to floods --riverine floods, ice jam floods, debris
jam floods, flash floods --will in  most cases be a matter of historical record, as
will flood elevations.(However, planners must be alert to development
upstream or extensive paving over of the ground that used to absorb runoff.)The NWS maintains a list of communities with potential fl ash flood problems,
and stream flow data for large watersheds is kept by the USGS in cooperation
with State and local agencies.

 potential fl ash flood problems,
and stream flow data for large watersheds is kept by the USGS in cooperation
with State and local agencies.

Results of the Corps of Engineers' dam survey,
as well as subsequent work done by many States, should be available to permit
plotting of dams with an evaluation of the risk they pose.Planners have access
to the National Flood Insurance Program's (NFIP) Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRM) and Flood Hazard Boundary Maps (FHBM), USGS topographic
maps, and soil maps prepared by the Soi l Conservation Service to use as base
maps.Estimating
Vulnerable
Zones
 Using the NFIP's maps and Flood Insurance Studies (FIS) as a base, the
planning team --consulting with an engineer for technical analysis --should plot
dams and levees as applicable , then adjust inundation levels behind levees and
progressively downstream of the dam.Where ice jams are a problem, base
flood fringe boundaries should be broadened to account for higher potential
flood elevations.Also, despite shallow flood elevations , it is important to map
alluvial fans as high risk areas.Note, too, that areas prone to flash flooding
from small streams and drainage ways may not always have been mapped as
such by the NFIP.See FEMA 116, Reducing Losses in High Risk Flood

 This section contains a listing of the functional annexes that typically would
require the preparati on of a hazard -specific appendices for flooding and dam
failure.It also identifies the unique and/or regulatory planning considerations
that should be examined by the planning team and used, as appropriate, when
preparing appendices for flooding and dam failure.Direction and
Control
 The extent of the initial response will depend on warning time, which varies with
the cause of the flooding and the distance a jurisdiction is from the origin of the
flooding.Intense storms may produce a flood in a few h ours or even minutes
for upstream locations, while areas downstream from heavy rains may have
from 12 hours to several weeks to prepare.

 in a few h ours or even minutes
for upstream locations, while areas downstream from heavy rains may have
from 12 hours to several weeks to prepare.

Flash floods occur within six hours
of the beginning of heavy rainfall, and dam failure may occur within hours of the
first signs of breaching, but floods from snowmelt can take months to develop.The EOPs of jurisdictions located downstream of a heavy flood source should
address the following planning considerations in one or more appendices to a
direction and control  annex:
Floodfighting
 Relevant floodfighting considerations include:
Ø Obtaining and keeping current a list of all dams in or near the
jurisdiction, by location and name.Ø Coordination with a dam’s staff during disaster or disaster threat
situations to facilitate expeditious notification and the exchange of
information.Ø Maps that identify the likely areas to be inundated by flood waters.Ø Identification of potential locations for the placement of temporary
levees and inclusion of this information on the  appropriate maps.Attachment B:  Flooding and Dam Failure
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)   page 6 -B-4
Ø Obtaining a labor force to perform flood fighting tasks associated with
building a levee (e.g.fill and place sand sandbags to prevent flooding).Ø Obtaining assistance from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build
temporary emergenc y levees.Search and
Rescue  Conduct aerial and waterborne search and rescue once flooding occurs.Include
provisions for the rescue of stranded animals and the disposal of dead ones.Continuity of
Operations  Address the relocation of government resour ces, vital records, and equipment
to assure continuation of services and to prevent damage or loss.Inspection and
Condemnation
 Structures left standing may still have been weakened by water pressure and
debris flows.Building interiors will be filled with mud and filth, and some
building materials will be waterlogged.Therefore, it will be necessary to inspect buildings and other structures to
determine whether they are safe to inhabit after a flood has occurred.Activities
may include:
Ø Identifyin g buildings and structures that may threaten public safety.Ø Designating those buildings and structures that may be occupied.Ø Identifying/marking those buildings and structures that are to be
condemned.

Ø Designating those buildings and structures that may be occupied.Ø Identifying/marking those buildings and structures that are to be
condemned.

Warning
 The NWS is responsible for most flood war ning efforts in the United States.For large river systems, hydrological models are used by River Forecast
Centers.For many --not all --smaller streams, the NWS has developed a
system called ALERT (Automated Local Evaluation in Real Time) that does not
rely on volunteer observers.However, some communities may still need to use
volunteer observers to monitor water levels, the effectiveness of the levee
system, or even to back up automated systems.The following planning
considerations should be addressed , if appropriate, in one or more appendices
to a warning annex:
Attachment B:  Flooding and Dam Failure
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)   page 6 -B-5
Automated
Warning  Include a listing that identifies location and telephone numbers for all automated
dam and river warning devices within or upstream of the jurisdiction, if available.Use of
Volunteers  If the jurisdiction relies on a volunteer warning network an appendix should
describe:
Ø Composition and locations of each team in the network.Ø How and when the network teams are activated (e.g., automatically
with an NWS flood watch or as directed by the Emergency Manager).Ø The type of information to be reported and the frequency of reporting.Ø The means established to facilitate reporting.Ø How warning information is passed on to response organization
members.Ø How the warning data receiv ed will be disseminated as emergency
public information.Dam Failure  In jurisdictions that are vulnerable to flooding from dam failure, an appendix
should include provision for:
Ø Alerting the Warning Coordinator and other key members of the
emergency m anagement staff when the local authorities receive
notification that a problem exists or may occur at the dam.Ø Disseminating emergency warning information (to the public and other
key response personnel) received from the dam's emergency
management staff.Typically, a warning message should address a
serious situation that could develop (alert) or inform the audience when
an excessively  high runoff occurs or a dam failure threatens (warning).

 threatens (warning).

Ø Coordinating with the PIO to facilitate the timely warning of the

(9/96)   page 6 -B-6
population at risk from dam failure.Emergency
Public
Information
 Public information begins with communication of risks to the community, to
potential home buyers, and to applicants for construction permits.Knowledge
of being in a flood zone, of b eing downstream of a dam, of being protected by
an inadequate levee, and the like, may rivet attention on the rest of the public
information strategy.The population should be educated about what the levels
of warning imply, should know how to interpret a  predicted flood level as it
relates to their property, and should be informed about expedient loss -reduction
measures they can apply to their property.Provisions must be made to prepare and disseminate notifications, updates, and
instructional message s as a follow -up to the original warning.The following
planning considerations should be addressed, if appropriate, in one or more
appendices to an EPI annex:
When Floods
Develop
Slowly  For flood emergencies that develop slowly enough to permit evacuati on,
provide the public information and instruction on:
Ø Expected elevation of the flood waters, and instructions on when to
evacuate.Ø Where to obtain transportation assistance to evacuate.Ø Designated travel routes and departure times.Ø Status of road c losures (what routes must be avoided due to probable
inundation).Ø What to take or not to take to shelters (including options available for
companion animals).Ø Location of mass care shelters and other assistance centers.Transition to
Recovery  As the initial response shifts to recovery, provide residents returning to their
homes information on safety precautions associated with:
Attachment B:  Flo oding and Dam Failure

safe drinking water.Ø Use of utilities.Ø Electric fields created in water by downed power l ines.

Evacuation
 If fast - and slow -developing floods are possible in a jurisdiction, protective
action decisions must be based on the estimated time necessary for evacuation
and the availability of shelter space above the estimated flood elevation.Wh en
complete evacuation is not feasible, citizens need to know where high ground is;
when evacuation is feasible, planning should have accounted for routes facing
possible inundation.In evacuation planning for floods, consideration must be
given not only to critical facilities and custodial institutions but also to
recreational areas prone to flooding, whether because the site is physically
isolated or because visitors isolate themselves from communication.Particular attention should be paid to critical facilities that are low -lying or in the
path of projected debris flows.Transportation routes subject to flooding should
also be noted, given the potential impact on evacuation and relief efforts.The following planning considerations should be addressed , if appropriate, in
one or more appendices to an evacuation annex:
Ø Maps that detail probable flood inundation areas and designated
evacuation routes.Ø Pickup points and government provided transport to move evacuees.Ø Provisions for moving the residents  of custodial facilities (hospitals, jails,
mental health facilities, nursing homes, retirement homes, etc.).Ø Coordination and implementation of mutual aid agreements with
adjacent jurisdictions to facilitate evacuation.Attachment B:  Flooding and Dam Failure
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)   page 6 -B-8
Mass Care
 The following planni ng considerations should be addressed, if appropriate, in
one or more appendices to a mass care annex:
Space/
Capacity
 Relevant considerations include:
Ø Identification of a sufficient number of mass care facilities to
accommodate the estimated number of  people that may be evacuated.Ø Availability of shelter space for a prolonged (up to 90 day) period.Safe Location
of  Facilities
This involves designating shelters for use that are located on high ground
(beyond the worst case inundation estimates).

Health and
Medical
 The following planning considerations should be addressed, if appropriate, in
one or more appendices to a health and medical annex:
Ø Provisions to keep people informed of the health and sanitary conditions
created by floods: flood wa ters may carry untreated sewage, dead
animals, disinterred bodies, and hazardous materials.Ø Monitoring water quality and sanitary conditions.Resource
Management
 The following planning considerations should be addressed, as appropriate, in
one or more appendices to a resource management annex:
Ø Provisions for purchasing, stockpiling or otherwise obtaining essential
flood fighting items such as sand bags, fill, polyethylene sheeting, and
pumps (of the right size and type, with necessary fuel, s et-up personnel,
operators, and tubing/pipes).Ø Resource lists that identify the quantity and location of the items
mentioned above, as well as points of contact (day, night, and
weekend) to obtain them.SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -C-1
Attachment C
Hazardous Materials
Given the technical nature of the HAZMAT threat, it is essential that the National Response Team’s
NRT -1, Hazardous Materials Emergency Planning Guide , and the Environmental Protection
Agency's (EPA) Technical Guidance for Hazard Analysis be used as the pri ncipal source documents
for addressing HAZMAT planning needs.Other helpful guides include the Handbook of Chemical
Analysis Procedures , co-published by the Department of Transportation (DOT), EPA, and FEMA,
and the planning section of the Guidelines for Public Sector Hazardous Materials Training ,
coordinated by FEMA under an agreement with DOT.The planning team should use the guides and
this attachment to help facilitate the completion of the hazard analysis and to identify unique planning
requirements that should be addressed in the EOP.The Hazard
Working
Definition of
Hazardous
Materials  Definition of a risk area for hazardous materials depends on defining "hazardous
materials."Many Federal laws and regulations exist to help the planner do just
that; however, since the various lists overlap and serve different purposes
(identifying acceptable quantities for "wastes" and "pollutants," reportable
quantities for "emergency releases," etc.

, since the various lists overlap and serve different purposes
(identifying acceptable quantities for "wastes" and "pollutants," reportable
quantities for "emergency releases," etc.

), this chapter will use the term
"hazardous materials" in a b road sense to include:
Ø Explosive, flammable, combustible, corrosive, oxidizing, toxic,
infectious, or radioactive materials
Ø that, when involved in an accident and released in sufficient quantities,
Ø put some portion of the general public in immediate dan ger from
exposure, contact, inhalation, or ingestion.Off-site planning for radiological accidents at nuclear power plants is addressed
in Tab 1 to Attachment F.  Radiological protection planning for the nuclear
conflict threat is addressed in Tab 2 to At tachment F.  Planning for the release
of lethal unitary chemical agents and munitions is addressed in Attachment E.
 For a discussion of the different lists of hazardous materials, see EPA's A
Review of Federal Authorities for Hazardous Materials Accid ent Safety , Chapter
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -C-1
 4.Note that substances not on these lists may still be hazardous.Risk Areas
 Areas at risk for hazardous materials transportation incidents lie along highways,
rail lines, pipelines, rivers, and port areas.A large number of Sta tes also are
potentially involved with nuclear waste incidents, given the routing for shipments.Jurisdictions with facilities that produce, process, or store hazardous materials
are at risk, as are jurisdictions with facilities for the treatment, storage , or
disposal of hazardous wastes.These risks are compounded by natural hazards
(e.g., earthquakes, floods) or, for highway transportation of hazardous
materials, poor weather conditions.In addition, other kinds of facilities (e.g.,
for natural gas) ma y contribute to risks posed by hazardous materials facilities.Locating
Hazardous
Materials
 This section discusses information made available to planners under Federal
law.States and localities may have additional or more stringent information
requirements, and planners may wish to check with their State Emergency
Response Commission (SERC), State Environmental Protection Agency, State
Department of Transportation, Public Service Commission, Radiological Health
Division of the State Health Departm ent, and the like for additional information.

 Departm ent, and the like for additional information.

Area Committees established under the auspices of the National Oil and
Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan (NCP) and the Oil Pollution
Act (OPA) may provide additional resources in identifying area s at risk from a
hazardous materials incident.At Fixed
Facilities
 EPCRA, or Title III of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act
(SARA),  requires facilities to notify the SERC and LEPC if they have present
any of the substances designated by  the EPA as an "extremely hazardous
substance" when the amount on hand exceeds the EPA -defined "threshold
planning quantity."Facilities must submit to the appropriate LEPC, local fire
department, and SERC a list of the "hazardous chemicals" (as defined b y the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA) on site in excess of
threshold quantities or the OSHA -required material safety data sheets (MSDS)
on each of these chemicals.In addition, facilities must provide the appropriate
LEPC, local fir e department, and SERC with an inventory form containing
general, aggregate (“Tier I”) information on amounts of the chemical present at
the facility and their location, or (upon a request made to the facility by the
LEPC, fire department, or SERC) more sp ecific (“Tier II”) information.LEPCs

may complete the general picture of the fixed facility hazard by obtaining data
from EPA's Toxic Chemical Release Inventory and by reviewing previous
notifications of accidental releases of "hazardous substances" in ex cess of
"reportable quantities" (as defined in 40 CFR 302).Interviews with facility
emergency coordinators, fire and law enforcement personnel, and news
reporters also may be used to obtain needed information.On Transport
Routes
 The LEPC is entitle d to information from facilities subject to SARA Title III that
may be necessary for emergency planning, and the LEPC is required by SARA
Title III to address routes for transportation of extremely hazardous substances
in emergency planning.

 LEPC is required by SARA
Title III to address routes for transportation of extremely hazardous substances
in emergency planning.

Facility emerg ency coordinators may provide
information on frequency of shipments, form and quantity of shipments, and
routes.Representatives of trucking, rail, air freight, and shipping industries also
may assist.Planners should know of State and local route desig nations for
hazardous materials shipments.Information is available from the Department of
Energy (DOE) or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission on nuclear waste
shipment routes, and from DOT on the routes for and volume of shipments
involving "highway route c ontrolled quantities" (HRCQ) of radioactive material.Estimating
Vulnerable
Zones
 Having plotted the location of facilities and transportation routes with the
potential for hazardous materials incidents, planners can estimate vulnerable
zones.The widest area of vulnerability would be for an airborne release.For
airborne releases of acutely toxic chemicals, vulnerable zones would be plotted
as circles around facilities --given uncertainty about wind direction --and as
corridors along land transporta tion routes.Calculating the radii for these circles
and corridors depends on knowing what concentration represents a "level of
concern" for health effects, the quantity of material likely to be released, the
likely rate of release, physical state of the material, elevation at which the release
occurs, wind speed, and surrounding topography or construction.In
determining vulnerable zones, planners will want to use both worst case and
more probable scenarios for the potential releases.Planners should tak e
advantage of any hazard assessments completed by facilities themselves, as
these can provide valuable information.The Risk Management Program under the Clean Air Act, Section 112(r), will
require facilities to conduct hazard assessments for a select ed list of about 140
toxic chemicals.The facilities are not required to have completed these hazard
assessments until May 1999.Attachment C:  Hazardous Materials
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -C-4
Determining
Vulnerability    Once vulnerable zones have been plotted, planners can assess the possible
consequences of pote ntial hazardous materials incidents.

.

In particular, planners
should look at what critical facilities (e.g., hospitals, utilities and treatment plants,
broadcast stations, police and fire stations, emergency operating centers) lie
within the vulnerable zon es; they should also note what facilities house people
with special evacuation needs (e.g., schools, prisons, hospitals and nursing
homes).SARA Title III requires identification of facilities subject to additional
risk due to their proximity to facilitie s that may release hazardous materials.Beyond the facility level, planners should consider the demographics of the
population in the area (particularly with regard to age and language use) and the
potential for property damage in the zone.They should a lso note the potential
for contamination of drinking water supplies and other environmental
consequences.The vulnerable facilities, bodies of water, and other features
should also be shown on a vulnerability map.Assessing
Risk
Finally, planners wi ll want to estimate the probability of incidents and the
severity of their consequences, in order to focus preparedness and prevention
efforts.Probability estimates may be simply qualitative (i.e., "low," "medium," or
"high"); in any case they can be base d on the historical record of releases and
incidents, on general transportation accident statistics for roads (and for airports
and railways), on fault tree analyses or hazard operability studies shared by
facilities, as well as on professional opinion.S ARA Title III requires the LEPC
to identify facilities (e.g., for natural gas) that, due to their proximity to facilities
that may release hazardous materials,  may contribute to risk; these should be
considered in assessing risk.Potential consequences m ay be estimated from
case studies of the worst incidents involving particular hazardous materials.Hazardous Materials Unique Planning Considerations
 This section contains a listing of the functional annexes that typically would
require the prepara tion of a hazard -specific appendix for hazardous materials.It
also identifies many of the unique and/or regulatory planning considerations that
should be examined by the planning team and used, as appropriate, when
preparing appendices specific to hazardo us materials.

Note that, whatever the
HAZMAT planning provisions adopted by the jurisdiction, SARA Title III
requires that HAZMAT emergency planning include training programs and
schedules for response and medical personnel, as well as methods and
Attachment C:  Hazardous Materials
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -C-5
schedul es for exercising the provisions.Direction and
Control
 For this hazard, OSHA's Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency
Response Standard (29 CFR 1910) requires that an ICS be used for on -scene
management of response activities.A description of ICS is provided in
Attachment A to Chapter 5.SARA Title III requires a community's plan to
include the designation of a community emergency coordinator and facility
emergency coordinators, who shall make determinations necessary to
implement the plan.Response
Actions  Response actions are triggered when the organization that is responsible for
managing HAZMAT response operations is notified.Response is initiated
when an incident or accident report is received from an operations center in a
facility that stores, manufactures, or uses hazardous materials or when a police
officer, fireman, or member of an emergency services organization is informed
of an emergency situation involving HAZMAT.SARA Title III requires
HAZMAT planning to address methods for det ermining the occurrence of a
release and the area or population likely to be affected, procedures for timely
notification of the community emergency coordinator by facility emergency
coordinators, and methods and procedures to be followed in response to a
release.Therefore, provisions should be made, as appropriate, to describe the on -scene
management structure and address the following planning considerations in one
or more appendices to a direction and control annex:
Ø Identify and designate special tech nical experts (chemists, toxicologists,
occupational health physicians, etc.to augment the response
organization.Where appropriate, private sector response organizations
(chemical manufacturers, commercial cleanup contractors, etc.)should
be part of t he response organization.Ø Notify response organizations, public officials, and  appropriate local
and State organizations that are directly  involved in the response.• From the initial incident report, disseminate as much information
as possible.

• If poss ible, identify the hazardous material involved and the
severity (degree of threat to people, property, environment,
etc.)of the accident before exposing response personnel to
possible health hazards.− For transportation accidents information sources in clude
placards, container labels, cargo manifests, and shipping
papers.These items provide initial information that can
be checked against the North American Emergency
Response Guidebook ; shipping papers should also
include an emergency contact number.Also, if the
above information is not visible or available, an
interview with the vehicle operator could provide the
information needed.− For fixed facility accidents, this information should be
readily available from the responsible party.Ø Initiate a r esponse to the situation in accordance with the jurisdiction's
ICS concept of operations for responding to HAZMAT accidents.Critical actions to address include:
• Upon arrival at the incident site, identifying the IC and notifying
the EOC of the identity o f the IC and the location of the ICP.• Ensuring response personnel have and don the appropriate
protective gear (clothing and breathing apparatus).• Ensuring response personnel approach the incident site from
upwind and obtain the following information,  if not already

removal may take place later.It also may be necessary to cover
some materials with tarps to prevent vap ors from rising.Additional
Notifications    Various Federal laws and regulations on hazardous  materials require
notifications from the responsible party (employer, transporter, facility
manager) --not necessarily from local or State agencies.Local and State

agencies may establish their own reporting requirements as well.The following
are typical notifications jurisdictions may be responsible for or interested in
ensuring:
Ø Chemical Releases .Notification should be made to the National
Response Center by the responsible party.Legal provisions also may
exist for notification of specific State and local authorities.• Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation,
and Liability Act (CERCLA) .For hazardous substances
identified in the CERCLA list, a  release that equals or exceeds

reported to the National Response Center.• Emergency Planning and Community Right -to-Know Act
(SARA Title III) .Releases of Extremely Hazardous
Substances (under se ction 302 of the Act) or of CERCLA
hazardous substances must be made known to the SERC and

For hazardous substances (as listed in 40
CFR 116.4) released into water in excess of reportable
quantities (established in 40 CFR 117.3), dischargers must
make an immediate report to the National Response Center.Notification must also be made to the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission if radioactive material spilled in a waterway
exceeds the reportable quantity.Ø General Transportation Accidents .Notifications are as above.In
addition, the North American  Emergency Response Guidebook
recommends contacting the Chemical Manufacturer's Association's
Chemical Transportation Emergency Center (CHEMTREC)  with initial
requests for assistance.Attachment C:  Hazardous Materials

• Involving Radioactive Materials .Typically, notification
should be made to the State Department of Public Health so

and may intervene to direct operations  in rare instances when the situation
exceeds the capability of the responsible party or State and local government
(or when the “responsible party” would be the Department of Defense (DOD)
or DOE).Assistance may include support by the National Strike For ce,
including strike teams for oil spill response and a Public Information Assistance
Team; Radiological Emergency Response Teams; salvage teams; scientific
support coordinators; and other specialized resources.For peacetime radiological emergencies, t he Federal Radiological Emergency
Response Plan (FRERP) provides a mechanism for DOE to dispatch
Radiological Assistance Program (RAP) teams in response to a State request
for monitoring assistance.Warning
 SARA Title III requires that HAZMAT emergency  planning address
procedures for timely notification to the public that a release has occurred; this
depends on facilities making immediate notification to State and local authorities.HAZMAT accidents generally occur without warning, and the speed at whic h
events develop and effects spread varies from incident to incident.For small -
scale occurrences, public notification may be made door -to-door,  through
mobile public address systems, or with portable megaphones.For  larger -scale
occurrences, a jurisdic tion-wide warning system should be used.The following
considerations should be addressed, if appropriate, in an appendix to a warning
annex:
Ø If used, description of and responsibility for activating a HAZMAT
warning system and its mode of operation (how  it is activated, where
located, number of warning devices (sirens, horns, whistles, etc.)in the

preparatio n and dissemination of notifications, updates, and instructional
messages as a follow -up to initial warning.The following planning
considerations should be addressed, if appropriate, in one or more appendices
to an EPI annex:
Ø Informing the public of hea lth hazards associated with the HAZMAT
involved in the accident.Ø Providing personal protective actions instructions, including:
• Survival tips for people on what to do immediately after a
HAZMAT release has occurred.• Instructions for in -place protection (when to stay, where to
stay, and what to do) when that option is chosen.• Event -specific evacuation instructions and information (routes,
road closures, available transportation) when that option is
chosen.Note that LEPCs also will be working toward  ensuring that area residents are
informed of risks in the area, of first aid measures and in -place protective
actions they can take, and of what to do if an evacuation is ordered in response
to a hazardous materials incident.Evacuation
 SARA Title III  requires HAZMAT emergency planning to address evacuation,
including provisions for a precautionary evacuation and alternative traffic routes.Hazardous materials evacuation planning is little different from evacuation
planning in general.The most impor tant difference is that initial movements
should be crosswind.Another difference is that some transportation incidents
Attachment C:  Hazardous Materials

zones around locations that present a significant threat to the public.Ø Pickup points and government provided transport to move evacuees.Ø Provisions for moving special needs population (residents of custodial
facilities such  as hospitals, jails, mental health facilities, nursing homes,
retirement homes, etc.)in a HAZMAT situation.Ø Tracking extent of evacuations ordered by the IC(s) during response
operations.Evacuation may not be always necessary or advisable: In-place pr otection
may be the preferred option.For some chemical hazards, using wet towels and
shutting off air circulation systems may suffice; sometimes the cloud may move
past more quickly than the evacuation can be effected.Also, if the hazardous
materials i ncident results from another hazard event (such as an earthquake or a
flood), any protective action decision will have to factor in additional concerns.If appropriate, an appendix or tab should be prepared that outlines the criteria
that will be used to determine when to rely on in -place protection instead of
evacuation to protect the public at risk.The following concerns should be
addressed:
Ø Health risks (respiratory and skin) associated with duration of exposure.Ø Speed of onset and persistence of the HAZMAT.Ø Use of barriers (overhead protection, closing windows and doors,
seeking shelter in home basements, etc.)to reduce exposure.Attachment C:  Hazardous Materials

Hurricane
The Hazard
Nature of the
Hazard
 The term "hurricane" describes a severe tropical cyclone and sustained winds of
74 miles per hour (mph) or greater that occurs along the Gulf  or East Coasts, in
the Caribbean, or in the Pacific along the west coasts of Mexico and California
or near Hawaii.Tropical cyclones in other areas of the world will have different
names (e.g., typhoon).The hurricane season runs from the first of Jun e until the end of November.Yet
hurricanes have occurred in every month of the year.

 November.Yet
hurricanes have occurred in every month of the year.

Hazard Agents
 The primary hazard agents associated with a hurricane are the high, sustained
winds; flooding from storm surge or heavy rains; battering from heavy wave s;
and a variety of secondary hazards:
Ø High Winds .The high winds impose significant loads on structures,
both direct wind pressure and drag, and tend to propel loose objects at
high velocity.Ø Flooding .The hurricane can cause many different types of  flooding.Along the coast the flooding may occur from storm surge, wind -driven
water in estuaries and rivers, or torrential rain.The flooding can be still
water flooding or velocity flooding caused by wave action associated
with wind driven water along the coast.The rainfall associated with a
hurricane is on the order of 6 to 12 inches, with higher levels common.The rain may precede landfall by hours and may persist for many hours
after landfall, causing severe flooding.Ø Heavy Waves .The storm may g enerate waves up to 25 feet high.These can batter the coastline, causing devastating damage to the
shoreline itself and to structures near the shore.The velocity of the
water moving back and forth undermines the foundations of building and
piers by remo ving the soil from around them.Debris driven inland by
Attachment D:  Hurricane

the waves can cause severe structural damage;
persons exposed to the moving water and debris are likely to receive severe
injuries.Ø Secondary Hazards .Hurricanes can also cause numerous secondar y
hazards.Tornadoes and electric power outages are common.Contamination of water supplies, flooding of sewage treatment facilities,
and even dam failure may occur.Estimating the
Force of
Hurricanes  The Saffir -Simpson scale is a widely recognized an d accepted practical tool
planners rely on to estimate the destructive forces associated with hurricanes.This scale classifies hurricanes into five categories based on wind speed and
describes the destructive forces caused by wind, storm surge, and wave action
for each category.The categories are listed below.

Hurricane Category     Wind Speed (mph)
  1      74-95
  2      96-110
  3      111-130
  4      131-155
  5      156+
A copy of the Saffir -Simpson scale is located at the end of this attachmen t, as
Table 6 -D-1.It should be used to obtain detailed information on each storm
category.Risk Area
 To determine the risk area, each jurisdiction's planning team in the hurricane
high-risk States should use the Hurricane Evacuation Technical Data Re port, if
available; FISs and FIRMs; and other local information sources such as maps
and historical data on previous hurricanes and other storms that have caused
injuries and/or loss of life, property damage, and disruption of essential services.Assess ment
of Risk
 A vulnerability assessment should be prepared.The assessment identifies the
population, facilities, property, land area, etc.that are vulnerable to the hazard
agents associated with a hurricane.The assessment provides the planning team
Attachment D:  Hurricane
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -D-3
the essential data it needs to determine the hurricane category for which the
jurisdiction should prepare.It is vital that the team plan for the highest
category of hurricane that is likely to strike the jurisdiction.The
assessment should:
Ø Include a na rrative description that identifies the parts of the jurisdiction
that are subject to flooding caused by a storm surge.Also, maps that
pictorially display this information.Ø Identify the population at risk.Ø Identify essential services (fire, police, uti lity substations/plants, etc.)and
special custodial facilities at risk (hospitals, nursing homes, jails and
juvenile correction facilities, etc.).Ø Identify government resources such as essential equipment, tools,
stockpiles, vital records, etc., that may  need to be moved to a safe
location.Ø Identify facilities that must be evacuated  such as trailer parks,
campgrounds, etc.

Hurricane Unique Planning Considerations
 This section contains a listing of the functional annexes that typically would
require the preparation of a hazard -specific appendix for hurricanes.It also
identifies many of the unique and/or regulatory planning considerations that
should be examined by the planning team and used, as appropriate, when
preparing hurricane -specific appen dices.General:
Response
Schedule  For this hazard a Hurricane Response Schedule is used in each of the hazard -
specific appendices to describe the emergency response actions that should be
accomplished when responding to a hurricane.The schedule establi shes phases
for the approaching hurricane, describes the activities to be completed during
each phase, and sets the priority for the activities to be completed.Each phase
covers a discrete period of time and details the specific actions that should be
completed during the phase.Attachment D:  Hurricane
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -D-4
Time Phases  Usually, phases correspond to hours before the estimated time of arrival of
gale/hurricane force winds, immediate response actions after landfall of
hurricane force winds, through termination of all response activit ies.Typical
phases include:
Ø Awareness .72-60 hours before the arrival of gale force winds (32 -63
mph).Ø Stand -by.60 -48 hours before the arrival of gale force winds.It is
likely that a tropical storm watch would be issued during this period.Ø Respon se.48 hours before arrival of gale force winds through
termination of the emergency.Hurricane watches and warnings would
be issued by the NWS during this period.Keying
Actions to
Time Phases  Each phase in the schedule:
Ø Describes actions to be t aken in the phase.Ø Identifies the official responsible for the action.Ø Defines the hours needed before arrival of gale force winds to carry out
the activity.Ø Describes the priority of the action to be taken.Ø Contains other critical information that tas ked organizations need to
perform their assigned responsibilities.Direction and

 Ø Determine when response organizations should:
• Be placed on stand -by, partial activation, or full activation.Attachment D:  Hur ricane
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -D-5
• Suspend or curtail day -to-day functions and  services and focus
on emergency response tasks.Ø Ensure response organizations can continue to perform assigned
operational tasks throughout all three phases ( e.g.secure, disperse, or
relocate operations centers, vehicles, equipment, vital records, and
other essential resources).Ø Determine timing for taking action on the following critical concerns:
• Alerting the public.• Closing schools and businesses.• Restr icting access to the risk area.• Opening mass care facilities.• Ordering an evacuation.Ø Assign specific tasking to each response organization for each phase.Critical concerns include:
• Decision for and timing to:
− Initiate coordination and implement mut ual aid
agreements with other jurisdictions.− Suspend non -emergency government services and
operations.− Release  non -emergency government employees from
work.• Reporting status/observations to the EOC.Attachment D:  Hurricane

Warning
 Since hurricanes are typically slow -movin g storms, sufficient warning time will
be available to allow those people at risk to evacuate and find a safe place to
stay before the storm reaches land.The following provisions for notifying the public should be addressed, if
appropriate, in one or mo re appendices to a warning annex.Ø Roles and responsibilities of government spokespersons during each
phase.Ø Coordination with the NWS and media representatives to ensure timely
and consistent warning information is provided.Emergency

The following planning considerations should be addressed, if appropriate, in
one or more appendices to an EPI annex:
Ø Instructions for preparing homes/businesses (inside and outside) to

(e.g., remember that the eye of the storm is not the e nd of the storm).Ø Instructions on implementing any hurricane -specific provisions for
evacuation (e.g., when and where to go).Ø Locations of mass care facilities that have been opened.Evacuation
 Where available, hurricane evacuation studies conduct ed by the States, the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, the National Hurricane Center, and FEMA should
be used to obtain vital evacuation planning data.The information gained from
such studies and the risk assessment should be used to develop the planning
instructions that will be relied upon to carry out an evacuation for those people
at risk.These planning instructions detail the time -phased actions to be taken to
evacuate people and relocate, if practical, essential services, special custodial

Ø Identifying  specific evacuation zones.These zones delineate the natural
and manmade geographic features of the areas(s) to be evacuated.Ø Designating evacuation routes for each zone.Ø Estimating the number of people requiring transportation support t o

evacuation under various hurricane threats.Consider the following
complications that could impede or delay evacuation before finalizing
the time -phased actions:
• Heavy rains and localized flooding may slow traffic movement.• Bridge approaches may flood before evacuation can be
completed.• Evacuees will need time to close up their homes and businesses,
secure their boats, gather the essentials (medicines, food,
clothing, etc.)to take with them, fill their vehicle with gas, etc.

Lethal Unitary Chemical Agents and Munitions
Public Law 99 -145, Section 1412, directs DOD to dispose of the lethal unitary chemical agents and
munitions st ored at eight Army installations within the continental United States.After an exhaustive
study comparing the alternative disposal strategies, the Army issued a Final Programmatic
Environmental Impact Statement (FPEIS) for the Chemical Stockpile Disposal  Program (January 1988)
recommending on -post incineration at each site.In the February 1988 Record of Decision (ROD), the
Army committed to establishing an emergency response program as a means of mitigating accidents
during storage and for disposal ope rations.In August 1988, the Army and FEMA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) identifying the
specific responsibilities of the Army and FEMA, defining areas of each agency's expertise, and outlining
where cooperation between the two agencies would  result in a more efficient use of personnel and
material resources.These obligations were integrated into a program called CSEPP.The Army has
overall responsibility for developing on -post preparedness plans, upgrading on -post response
capabilities, cond ucting on -post training and has the lead for technical research, post -incident cleanup
standards and data automation activity.FEMA is responsible for working with State and local
governments in developing off -post preparedness plans, upgrading off -post r esponse capabilities, and
conducting off -post training.The chemicals weapons depots affect ten States and their emergency planners.However, chemical munitions, many
still containing chemical agents,  have been found in old dump sites, current and form er military installations, old
industrial sites, and at spurious unappreciated non -stockpile locations throughout the United States.It is
possible that State and local planners could be contacted by the Army or FEMA to prepare short -term operations
plans  to address these situations.The information which follows should be helpful in responding to emergencies
caused by these non -stockpile munitions.The Hazard

Nature of
the Hazard  The chemical agents of primary concern to CSEPP are the nerve agen ts GA,
GB and VX, and the vesicant (blister) agents H, HT and HD.

The chemical
and physical properties of these agents have a direct bearing on emergency
planning and response because they determine the agents' volatility, behavior in
fires, and persisten ce in the environment.All of the agents are liquids at normal
indoor temperatures, although most sulfur mustards (H and HD) freeze at
ambient temperatures below 55 to 59o F. In the unlikely event of fires or
Attachment E:  Lethal Unitary Chemical Agents and Munitions
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -E-2
explosions, on -post personnel and the off -post general public also could be
exposed to agent combustion products as well as uncombusted agents.The agents GA, GB, and VX are rapidly acting, lethal nerve agents and are
toxic as liquids and vapors.The vesicant agents injure the eyes, damage the
lungs and severely blister the skin upon exposure.The vesicants often react with
tissue constituents, and there is significant evidence that exposure to sufficiently
high doses may increase the risk of developing cancer.The vesicant agents are
potent in minut e quantities and can produce delayed effects as late as 24 hours
after contact.In pure form, the nerve agents are usually odorless, colorless (agent VX may be
pale amber), and tasteless.GA and GB are nonpersistent nerve agents which
primarily present a vapor hazard.The vapors from these agents would be the
primary cause of casualties since they can be carried downwind quickly.Under
most release and meteorological conditions GA and GB produce the greatest
downwind hazard distance when compared to other  agents in the stockpile.VX is not very volatile, so it presents much less vapor hazard than GA and GB;
however, it is 100 times more toxic by the percutaneous route.In practical
terms, a toxic dose of VX is more likely to result from skin rather than
respiratory exposure; however, all nerve agents are sufficiently volatile to pose
an inhalation hazard.At agent concentrations of 30 mg/m3 or greater, median
lethal inhalation doses can be attained in a few minutes.

 median
lethal inhalation doses can be attained in a few minutes.

The chemical agents are stored in thr ee basic configurations: (1) projectiles,
cartridges, mines, and rockets containing propellant and/or explosive
components;  (2)  aircraft -delivered munitions that do not contain explosive
components; and  (3)  steel one -ton containers.Most of the stockp ile (61%) is
in this third form.All of the agents are at least 20 years old;  some are more
than 40 years old.Risk Area  The stockpiled agents are stored in chemical exclusion at eight U. S.
Department of Army  installations within the continental Uni ted States (all
percentage figures are based on weight):  Tooele Army Depot (TEAD), Utah
(42.3% of the total stockpile); Pine Bluff Arsenal (PBA), Arkansas (12.0%);
Umatilla Depot Activity (UMDA), Oregon (11.6%); Pueblo Depot Activity
(PUDA), Colorado (9.9 %); Anniston Army Depot (ANAD), Alabama (7.1%);
Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG), Maryland (5.0%); Newport Army

Ammunition Plant (NAAP), Indiana (3.9%); and Blue Grass Army Depot
(BGAD), Kentucky (1.6%).The remaining 6.6% of the stockpile is located on
Johns ton Island in the Pacific Ocean.For CSEPP, the EPZ concept involves three concentric zones, reflecting the
differing response requirements associated with a fast -breaking chemical event
with limited time for warning and response.The innermost planning zone is the
immediate response zone (IRZ), the middle zone is the protective action zone
(PAZ), and the outermost zone is the precautionary zone (PZ).Emergency response plans must reflect the fact that a release of chemical agent
will affect different areas in different ways and at different times.Areas near the
point of release are likely to experience relatively high concentrations of agent
very quickly, while areas farther away are likely to experience lower agent
concentrations after a longer perio d of time.

 to experience relatively high concentrations of agent
very quickly, while areas farther away are likely to experience lower agent
concentrations after a longer perio d of time.

Prompt and effective response is most critical in the IRZ because it would be
the first affected by an accidental release of chemical agent and would likely
receive the heaviest agent concentrations.This zone encompasses an area
requiring les s than one -hour response time when affected by an agent release
under "typical" weather conditions.The IRZ boundary ranges from 10 to 15 km
(6 to 9 miles) from the potential chemical event source, depending on the
stockpile location on -post.For these rea sons, emergency response plans
developed for the IRZ must provide for the most rapid and effective protective
actions possible.The PAZ is an area that extends beyond the IRZ to approximately 16 to 50 km
(10 to 30 miles) from the stockpile location.The  PAZ is that area where public
protective actions may still be necessary in case of an accidental release of
chemical agent, but where the available warning and response time is such that
most people could evacuate.The primary emergency response is evacua tion
because it is anticipated that there will be sufficient time to permit an orderly and
complete evacuation.However, other responses (e.g., sheltering) may be
appropriate for institutions and special populations that could not evacuate
within the avail able time.The PZ is the outermost portion of the EPZ and extends from the PAZ outer
Attachment E:  Lethal Unitary Chemical Agents and Munitions
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -E-3
boundary to a distance where the risk of adverse impacts to humans is
negligible.Because of the increased warning and response time available for
implementation of respo nse actions in the PZ, detailed local emergency planning
is not required, although consequence management planning may be
appropriate.CSEPP Planning Considerations
 The CSEPP Planning Guidance Document  provides information to be used
in prepari ng emergency plans that cover the most important aspects of CSEPP.

Developed jointly by FEMA and the Army, the CSEPP Planning Guidance
serves three principal purposes in the CSEPP:
Ø To promote the development of a comprehensive emergency response
capabili ty at each chemical agent stockpile location by providing
guidance and direction to assist State, local, and Army installation
planners in formulating, coordinating, and maintaining effective
emergency response plans;
Ø To ensure that critical planning deci sions are made consistently at all
eight chemical agent stockpile locations by establishing a single
adequate and systematic framework for emergency response planning
related to the CSEPP; and
Ø To provide a basis for assessing the adequacy of emergency
preparedness planning as a part of the evaluation of proposals for
Federal assistance.The CSEPP Planning Guidance does not contain all of the information and
detailed technical criteria that will eventually be required for comprehensive
emergency plans and resource programs at the eight stockpile locations.Additional location -specific and programmatic technical guidance is available in
a number of technical studies, either completed or ongoing.The CSEPP planning process involves a number of important tas ks: identify the
planning team; identify sources of technical and administrative support for the
planning team;  review existing plans to determine their status, to prevent
Attachment E:  Lethal Unitary Chemical Agents and Munitions

(9/96)  page 6 -E-4
overlap, and to eliminate inconsistency; analyze local hazards, determine risk,
and assess vulnerability; evaluate response capabilities and resources;  upgrade
existing plans or develop new plans and procedures; and develop an ongoing

Event
Assessment
Chemical event assessment involves determining the type and nature of an
incident or accident and its potential or actual imp act.Assessment is both initial
and extended.Initial assessment (conducted by installation personnel) primarily
involves activities such as analysis and monitoring; agent identification and
classification; dispersion modeling and dose projection; and con version of
assessment information to emergency response considerations.Extended
monitoring activities will be determined by the nature of the accident and
release.

classification; dispersion modeling and dose projection; and con version of
assessment information to emergency response considerations.Extended
monitoring activities will be determined by the nature of the accident and
release.

Emergency
Notification
and Event
Levels  Army and local officials must identify the typ e and detail of information that the
installation must communicate to the off -post authorities to assist the latter in
deciding upon protective actions.Such information includes, but is not limited
to, name of communicator; verification number (if commerc ial telephone is used)
or authenticator; time of notification; emergency level; time of event; brief
description of event; projected areas of impact; meteorological data; and a
recommendation for the implementation of protective actions.Transmission of a
hard copy of this information should follow as soon as possible.There are
significant benefits in a standard emergency assessment and notification system
at each Army installation.Four event levels have been established in CSEPP,
with increasing degrees of impact:  Non -Surety Emergency; Limited Area
Emergency; Post Only Emergency; and Community Emergency.The Army
installation will notify the designated off -post point(s) of contact of the actual or
likely occurrence, its chemical event emergency notificati on level, and the
recommended protective action within 5 minutes from initial detection of an
actual or likely chemical agent release at APG, ANAD, BGAD, NAAP, and
PBA, and within 10 minutes from initial detection of an actual or likely release at
PUDA, TE AD, and UMDA.Emergency Because the chemical agent stockpile is under Federal jurisdiction, the National

Operations
Plan Contingency Plan delegates the responsibility for on -scene coordination to the
DOD.Therefore, the Federal OSC will be an Army rep resentative.If the
release of a chemical agent results in the declaration of Federal emergency or
disaster, FEMA also will be involved through its Federal Coordinating Officer
(FCO).Each jurisdiction's command and control procedures should include
consideration of the relationship between the OSC and the civilian emergency
management structure.In this context, each jurisdiction must identify the organizational structure it will
use to respond to a chemical agent release.Key components of the struct ure
include:
Ø The individual (and alternates) with authority to provide central

 it will
use to respond to a chemical agent release.Key components of the struct ure
include:
Ø The individual (and alternates) with authority to provide central
management of the community's emergency response.

Ø Other parties that will support the management function by providing
advice and information.Ø The response forces and othe r resources available to respond to the
emergency (including those under direct control of the jurisdiction as
well as those to be obtained from other governments or from private
sources).Ø The organizational framework that will be used to coordinate the i nput
of all parties to ensure an effective and comprehensive response to the
emergency.Emergency
Operations
Center  An EOC developed under the CSEPP should provide a command and control
center for potential emergencies related to the storage and dispos al of the
chemical agent stockpile as well as for other potential emergencies identified in
the community's hazard assessment.An effective EOC consists of the
combination of physical facilities, equipment, personnel, and procedures that
enables the juris diction to apply its resources efficiently and effectively to
respond to an emergency situation.Detailed guidelines for staffing, organization,
and operation of the EOC are presented in the CSEPP Planning Guidance.Attachment E:  Lethal Unitary Chemical Agents and Munitions
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -E-7
Emergency
Worker
Operations  CSEPP takes a two -pronged approach to advancing the safety of civilian
emergency response personnel.First, no civilian workers will be intentionally
placed in positions where they will encounter chemical agent during the
performance of their duties.Second, wor kers who may incidentally encounter
chemical agent while performing their duties will be provided with appropriate
protective clothing, equipment, and training.Under these guidelines, civilian responders will not enter any area where
chemical agent is k nown or suspected to be present while the release of agent is
ongoing.While the release is in progress, civilian emergency workers may
perform duties (such as traffic and access control and emergency medical
services) outside the known/suspected hazard ar ea.After the release has
stopped and chemical agent monitoring has confirmed that agent concentrations
are within the range for which the protective clothing and equipment provide
protection, civilian responders may enter the hazard area to perform necess ary
duties such as search and rescue and accompanying off -site Army monitoring
personnel.

 to perform necess ary
duties such as search and rescue and accompanying off -site Army monitoring
personnel.

All personnel whose duties during or after the release may bring them
into contact with chemical agent will be required to use protective clothing and
equipment speci fied in these guidelines.Automation  Automated systems can provide important assistance in performing many of the
planning and response functions in CSEPP.The quickness with which a
chemical agent release could affect on -post and off -post populations  argues
strongly in favor of using automated tools to help perform complex analyses
during planning and to manage the deployment of personnel and resources
during response.State and local jurisdictions are strongly encouraged to make
maximum use of autom ation tools being developed for CSEPP.Communications  Reliable communication systems ensure the notification and subsequent
information sharing can occur without delay.In CSEPP, at least two
independent methods of simultaneous communications must be av ailable to
protect against the possibility of equipment failure.A communications network,
consisting of redundant telephone and radio systems, should be designed and
installed to link the Army installation EOC and notification point with the EOCs
and not ification points of all IRZ counties and the State(s).Regardless of
whether the telephone or radio system is designated the primary method of
communication, the other system must be provided to serve as a backup.Attachment E:  Lethal Unitary Chemical Agents and Munitions
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -E-8
Warning  The objectives of the public alert and notification system (ANS) are:
Ø To alert essentially every person within the IRZ of an emergency that
has the potential of causing harm to those persons.Ø To notify essentially every affected person within the IRZ of appropriate
protective act ions.The IRZ warning system must provide both an alerting signal and instructional
message within 8 minutes from the time a decision has been made that the public
is in danger.To achieve rapid notification, CSEPP endorses the concept of a
dual indoor -outdoor warning system.Outdoor
Systems  Only omnidirectional electronic sirens with voice message capability are
acceptable as the primary outdoor alerting and notification devices for CSEPP.

 notification devices for CSEPP.

The network of siren/voice units is configured so that the ale rt signals and
notification messages received in each area of the IRZ are of sufficient volume
to be heard distinctly above ambient noise levels in the area.Community
characteristic descriptions, with their associated sound pressure level
requirements, ar e identified in the CSEPP Planning Guidance.Indoor
Systems  An acceptable indoor alert and notification device must be reliable and not be
easily disabled.CSEPP supports several options: tone alert receivers, NOAA
Specific Area Message Encoder (SAME)  receivers, and EAS -capable
receivers.Two supporting technologies to augment the receivers include
simultaneous telephone activations and interruption of cable television
programming for special announcements.PAZ Alert and notification for the popula tion in the PAZ is provided by a system
designed for specific applications such as population centers and institutions,
coupled with electronic media, EAS broadcasts, and route alerting.Public alert
and notification system requirements within the PAZ sho uld be viewed as
transitioning between the exacting requirements for the IRZ to basically no
requirements for the PZ.Emergency
Public
Information  CSEPP encourages an aggressive public education and information campaign as
an essential ingredient of a n effective emergency preparedness program.The
pre-emergency public education program raises public awareness of the
hazards associated with the chemical agent stockpile and advises citizens of
Attachment E:  Lethal Unitary Chemical Agents and Munitions
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -E-9
actions they can take, both before and during an emergency, t o reduce risks to
themselves and their property.Public education also informs individuals of the
progress of Chemical Stockpile and Chemical Demilitarization activities as they
relate to emergency preparedness.The emergency public information program
identifies the information that will need to be communicated to the public in the
event of a chemical agent release and a strategy for disseminating this
information rapidly.CSEPP endorses the use of a  single JIC as the most efficient method for
gatherin g, coordinating and disseminating emergency information.

 most efficient method for
gatherin g, coordinating and disseminating emergency information.

Each
jurisdiction will develop agreements and procedures, in cooperation with all
affected local jurisdictions, State emergency management officials, and the
Army installation, that will be followed  to ensure the coordinated release of
information during an emergency.A related task for JIC personnel is the
control of rumors.Evacuation
and In -Place
Sheltering  The basic protective action choices are evacuation and four types of shelter -in-
place inc luding normal shelter -in-place, and sheltering improved by expedient
measures, permanent enhancements, or pressurization.Protective
Action
Decision -
Making  The protective action decision process consists of these steps:
Ø Identifying the situations un der which evacuation would not be
appropriate.Ø Determining what action provides the best protection when evacuation
is inappropriate.Ø Evaluating the situation at the time of an emergency to determine
whether evacuation or the alternative action should be implemented.To ensure quick and appropriate emergency response, the first two steps are
determined during emergency planning along with a process designed for
accomplishing the third step.Protective
Action
Decision Table  Emergency planners analyze the interaction of accident categories, as defined by
the EPG (Emergency Planning Guide), and population characteristics to identify
the protective actions that would be appropriate for different segments of the
population under different accident categori es.The results of this analysis are
Attachment E:  Lethal Unitary Chemical Agents and Munitions
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -E-9
classified into a set of protective action strategies.Each strategy lists the
protective action recommended for the population of each area and for each
special population and institution under a given set of release and meteorological
conditions.Each protective action strategy is concisely summarized in table
form.Evacuation
Planning
Requirements  CSEPP requires planners to identify the optimum evacuation strategy for each
area of the EPZ and all special popula tions (including any on -post personnel)
for which evacuation has been identified as a possible protective action by using
a quantitative evacuation time study.This includes an analysis of:
Ø The number of people and vehicles to be evacuated compared with
capacities of the roadways that can be used for the evacuation.

This includes an analysis of:
Ø The number of people and vehicles to be evacuated compared with
capacities of the roadways that can be used for the evacuation.

Ø The number and location of people without access to automobiles
compared with the supply of mass transportation vehicles that can be
made available.Ø The number and location of persons w ith special evacuation needs (e.g.,
the disabled) compared with the availability of personnel and vehicles
with the capability to meet those needs.In-Place
Sheltering
Planning
Requirements  Communities are required to develop a detailed sheltering -in-place plan for
each of the four sheltering strategies.The plan will identify all structures to be
used as shelters and will describe the program the jurisdiction will pursue to
implement the given strategy in these structures.The plan will determine the
resources necessary to implement the protection strategy in all affected
structures and present a checklist of actions that inspectors will consider for
reducing infiltration in each structure.The community will develop the capabilities to, assign respons ibilities for, and
ensure the availability of resources to:
Ø Notify people in appropriate areas to implement expedient shelter -in-
place.Attachment E:  Lethal Unitary Chemical Agents and Munitions
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -E-10
Ø Determine (in consultation with the Army installation) when the shelters
should be abandoned.Ø Advise people in s elected areas to abandon their shelters without risking
the inappropriate abandonment of shelters in other areas.Ø Ensure prompt evacuation of all people who have been advised to leave
their shelters.Access
Control  Access control points (ACP) will be p re-designated to allow the immediate
dispatch of personnel and commitment of resources.Access control for a
chemical event affecting off -post areas also will be necessary if the Army
creates a National Defense Area (NDA) off the installation.Off -post l aw
enforcement officials may be needed to assist on -post security personnel in this
event.The creation of an NDA permits the Army to use military forces to
effectively control non -Federal lands or areas when necessary for reasons of
national security.

Evacuee
Support
The two primary components of an evacuee support system in CSEPP are
reception and mass care.Reception is the process of receiving and registering
evacuees, determining their needs (i.e., medical, housing, family reunification,
etc.)and assigning them to appropriate resources.Mass care includes providing
shelter, food, family reunification, limited medical care, and social services for
evacuees.Reception and mass care facilities may be collocated when a small
number of evacuees are  involved.Separate reception and mass -care facilities
are appropriate in a larger -scale evacuation.Health and
Medical  Health and medical concerns associated with the hazard and CSEPP include the
following:
Decontamination  Decontamination is an inte gral part of the treatment of people contaminated with
chemical agent.This must be done quickly following exposure.Regardless of
the type of chemical agent involved, personal decontamination can be
performed by flushing undiluted household bleach on all  contaminated areas
(except the face) and rinsing off with lukewarm, soapy water.This can be done
by the individual who is contaminated, another person or by a decontamination
team.CSEPP stresses the importance of self - and buddy -decontamination
because  of the critical time factors in performing this task.CDC Medical
Guidelines
 The CDC of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have
prepared recommendations for medical preparedness for CSEPP civilian
communities and have published these reco mmendations in the Federal Register
(60 FR 33308, June 27, 1995).Ø

 requiring certain special
response and resource allocations not normally associated with more common
emergencies such as floods, windstorms, or some hazardous materials
accidents.

For this reason, planning for resource coordination and allocation
becomes especially critical and should be coordinated with respect to planning
zones and their related protectiv e actions.Critical to implementing the resource management components of the EOP in
CSEPP are the automation systems.The objectives of the CSEPP automation
system are to:
Ø Store, manage, and access databases to support planning efforts.Ø Interface da tabases with analytical planning tools and models.Ø Provide automation support for daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly
planning tasks (e.g., reporting, scenario development, training, exercise
planning).Ø Organize emergency plan concepts and standard opera ting procedures.Ø Provide rapid access to information and pre -authorized implementation
procedures to support command and control and protective action
decisions.Ø Facilitate effective communication and alert/notification.Ø Track and log events.Ø Provi de a means of effectively managing emergency response
resources.SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning

Radiological Hazards
Radiological materials have many uses and serve a very important purpose in our country.Some of their
most common uses include:
Ø Use by doctors to det ect and treat serious diseases.Ø Use by educational institutions and companies for research.Ø Use by the military to power large ships and submarines.Ø Use by companies in the manufacture of products.Ø Use as a critical base material to help produce the  commercial electrical power that is generated
by a nuclear power plant.Ø Use as one of the critical components in nuclear weapons, which are relied upon to help deter
the threat of war.Under extreme circumstances an accident or intentional explosion  involving radiological materials can
cause very serious problems.Consequences may include death, severe health risks to the public,
damage to the environment, and extraordinary  loss of, or damage to, property.This attachment focuses on the unique and regulatory planning requirements associated with the two
radiological hazard threats that pose the most significant risks to a community:
Ø An accident at a nuclear power plant, and
Ø Nuclear conflict with one or more nations that may be hostile to the United States.

 power plant, and
Ø Nuclear conflict with one or more nations that may be hostile to the United States.

The description of the hazard and both radiological and direct weapons (blast, fire) effects in Tab 2 to
this attachment apply also to the threat of nuclear terrorism.That is, the same effects and consequences
would be associated with the  "intentional" detonation of a nuclear device or weapon by a terrorist group
seeking to maximize the blast, fire, and radiological effects.Planning for response to transportation accidents that involve the accidental spread or release of

Nuclear Power Plant Accident
Given the regulatory considerations associated with planning for response to a nuclear power plant
accident, it is essential that NUREG -0654/FEMA -REP-1, Rev.1, its supplements, and FEMA
Guidance Memoranda be used as the primary source docu ments for addressing the planning needs
associated with this hazard.The information in this attachment complements the planning guidance cited
above and is intended to help facilitate the identification of the necessary planning considerations that
shoul d be addressed if the jurisdiction chooses to include this hazard in its all -hazard EOP.The Hazard
Nature of the
Hazard
 Radioactive materials are produced in the operation of nuclear reactors.The
accidental release of these materials into the atmo sphere can harm people and
damage the environment.Risk Area
 The risk area associated with accidents at a fixed commercial nuclear power
reactor is divided into two specific geographic areas called EPZs.EPZs define
the areas for which planning is needed  to ensure prompt and effective actions
are taken to protect the health and safety of the public if an accident occurs.Although in theory an EPZ is a circle centered on the power plant, the size and
actual shape of each EPZ will be determined by the char acteristics of a
particular site (e.g., topography, identifiable landmarks, etc.).

 the size and
actual shape of each EPZ will be determined by the char acteristics of a
particular site (e.g., topography, identifiable landmarks, etc.).

The plume exposure pathway (10 -mile EPZ) includes everything within
approximately a 10 -mile radius of the power plant.Human health and safety
risks associated with it i nclude: whole body injury from exposure to gamma
radiation; and thyroid, lung, and possibly other organ injury from inhalation of
radioactive materials.The ingestion exposure pathway (50 -mile EPZ) includes everything within
approximately a 50 -mile radius  of the power plant.Human health and safety
risks associated with it include whole body and thyroid injury from ingestion of
radiologically contaminated water and food.Environmental concerns associated with both EPZs include contamination of:

 Ø Peopl e.
Ø The water supply.Ø The crops and feed that people, domesticated animals, and wildlife
consume.Ø The livestock and milk or milk products that people consume.Ø The areas people occupy (i.e.where they work, live, play, etc.).Nuclear Power Plant Acci dent Unique Planning Considerations
This section contains a listing of the functional annexes that typically would
require the preparation of a hazard -specific appendix for nuclear power plant
accidents.It also identifies many of the unique and regula tory planning
considerations that should be examined by the planning team  and addressed, as
appropriate, when preparing nuclear power plant accident hazard -specific
appendices.Direction and
Control  For this hazard, four emergency classification levels  (ECL) have been
established.These ECLs describe the specific emergency actions that must be
accomplished by the licensee and off -site emergency response organizations.As
the emergency situation escalates from a small on -site problem to an emergency
with off-site implications, each of the emergency classification levels provides
for a gradual expansion of response actions as the situation warrants.The four
levels are: 1) Notification of Unusual Event, 2) Alert, 3) Site Area Emergency,
and 4) General Em ergency, this last being the most severe.Jurisdictions located in the 10 - and 50 -mile EPZs should include in their EOPs
the appropriate tasking for response organizations to accomplish the response
actions required by each of the emergency classificatio n and action levels.

 located in the 10 - and 50 -mile EPZs should include in their EOPs
the appropriate tasking for response organizations to accomplish the response
actions required by each of the emergency classificatio n and action levels.

When
more than one jurisdiction is located in the same EPZ it is necessary for the
jurisdictions to work together to sort out the response tasking each jurisdiction
will perform.Tab 1 to Attachment F:  Nuclear Power Plant Accident
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -F-1-3
The State is responsible for specifying the protective measures for the public
and response personnel for both the plume exposure and ingestion pathway
EPZs.Provisions should be made, as appropriate, to address the following planning
considerations in one or more appendices to a direction and control annex:
 Ø Describing the specific responsibilities assigned to the jurisdictional
response organizations located in both EPZs.Typical tasks include:
• Preparation of written agreements that specify the concept of
operations and specify the response roles of Fe deral agencies
and of State, local, and private sector  response organizations
located in the EPZ.• Provisions for sending a member from the emergency response
organization to the licensee's near -site Emergency Operations
Facility to serve as a liaison off icer, if needed.• Requirement to:
− Identify radiological laboratories that can be used to
provide radiological monitoring and analyses services .− Identify nuclear and other facilities, organizations, and
individuals that can provide resources or skills th at can
be relied upon to support the response effort.− Provide the personnel and equipment to perform off -
site radiological monitoring.− Inspect, inventory, and operationally check radiological
detection equipment and instruments at least once each
calenda r quarter and after each use .− Make rapid assessments of the actual or potential
magnitude and locations of radiological hazards caused
by a nuclear power plant accident.Tab 1 to Attachment F:  Nuclear Power Plant A ccident

Ø Tasking applicable to jurisdictional response organizations located
in the plume exposure pathway EPZ .Address:
• Provisions to accomplish field monitoring.• The means that will be used to detect and measure radioiodine
concentrations in the air (down to 10 -7 microcurie per cubic
centimeter).• Provisions for determining the best protective options and
measures (evacuation, sheltering, etc.)for the people in the risk
area during emergency conditions.• Provisions for traffic management and control of access to the
affected area.• Post-event actions to be taken by emergency response
personnel, as soon as en vironmental conditions and safety
considerations permit.These include:
− Provisions for relaxing the protective measures that
have been implemented.− Means to be used for determining the appropriate time
to allow evacuees and the general public to leave m ass
care facilities (if used) and return to their homes.Ø Tasking applicable to the jurisdictional response organizations
located in the ingestion pathway EPZ .Normally, the State
Tab 1 to Attachment F:  Nuclear Power Plant A ccident
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -F-1-4
emergency management organization will be primarily responsible for
the res ponse planning required for this EPZ.An appendix to the State
or local EOP (as appropriate) must address the provisions that have
been made:
• To detect contamination.• For implementing procedures that will protect the public and
prevent them from con suming contaminated foodstuffs.Protective actions may include impoundment, decontamination,
processing, weathering, and product replacement/substitution .• To prepare maps that can be used to record survey and
monitoring information applicable to farm cr ops, livestock, soil
samples, dairies, food processing plants, water sheds, water
supply intake and treatment plants, and reservoirs.The maps
must include all of the activities cited above that are located in
the 50 -mile EPZ.Ø Requests for Federal assista nce.In order to accurately quantify the
potential long term health and environmental consequences of an
accident, sophisticated monitoring equipment and scientific analytical
techniques are needed.Such equipment and technical expertise usually
are not maintained by State and local governments.

 order to accurately quantify the
potential long term health and environmental consequences of an
accident, sophisticated monitoring equipment and scientific analytical
techniques are needed.Such equipment and technical expertise usually
are not maintained by State and local governments.

Accordingly,
provisions for requesting Federal agency resources (those available
through the FRERP) to meet this need should be included in a tab to the
hazard -specific appendix .Communications
 Provisions m ust be made to ensure the State and local EOCs have a
communications link with the nuclear facility and the facility's near -site
Emergency Operations Facility, if manned.Warning
 The nuclear facility licensee is responsible for notifying off -site local and State
government response organizations in those jurisdictions that may be affected
when an emergency occurs.The following jurisdictional responsibilities for planning should be addressed in
one or more appendices to a warning annex:
Tab 1 to Attachment F:  Nuclear Power Plant Accident
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -F-1-6
Public
Warning    Warning of the public is a critical function related to this hazard.The public
must be given timely instructions with regard to the specific protective actions to
be taken.These instructions should describe the area(s) affected and address
evacuatio n, sheltering in place, etc., as appropriate to the situation and time
available.Further, the means chosen to accomplish the warning must ensure
public health and safety.Adjacent
Jurisdictions,
State(s), and
the Federal
Government    Provisions should  be made for notifying and coordinating with every jurisdiction
and level of government located within the 10 - and 50 -mile EPZs.Also, local
jurisdictions should contact their State EOC to confirm that they have been
notified by the licensee.The State E OC should alert the FEMA Regional
Office.Emergency
Public
Information
 This section deals with the provisions made to prepare and disseminate
notifications, updates, and instructional messages to follow up on the initial
warning information passed to t he public located within the plume exposure
pathway.The following planning considerations should be examined and addressed in one
or more appendices to an EPI annex:
Ø The procedures and means that will be relied upon to notify and warn
the public (incl uding residential, custodial, and transient populations).Ø Instructions for the immediate protective actions to take (e.g., close
windows and doors, stay indoors, shut off the heating and cooling
system, etc.).

Ø Evacuation instructions for evacuees (what to take, what to do about
pets and livestock, when to leave, evacuation routes, etc.).Ø Locations of mass care facilities (also called "congregate care" facilities)
and associated reception centers.Evacuation  The jurisdictions located in the plume exp osure pathway should use the
Tab 1 to Attachment F:  Nuclear Power Plant Accident
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -F-1-7
 population information gained from the risk assessment as a starting point to
develop the planning that will be relied upon to carry out an evacuation of
people at risk.The range of time between the onset of accident condition s and
the start of a major release of radiological materials into the atmosphere may
range from a few minutes to several hours, and may affect what protective
action needs to be taken.Once a release has started, it may continue for
several days.Critical  to the evacuation decision are the type of radiological
hazard that is threatening the public, conditions at the power plant, time
available to implement an evacuation, and the protective measures called for in
the State’s plan.In all cases the protecti ve actions taken must be consistent
with the EPA protective action guide regarding human exposure to the passage
of a radioactive airborne plume.The following planning considerations should be addressed, as appropriate, in
one or more appendices to an e vacuation annex:
Ø Identifying specific evacuation zones.These zones delineate the natural
and manmade geographic features and boundaries of the risk area(s) to
be evacuated.Ø Preparing maps that show the specific evacuation routes for each zone,
identif y the preselected radiological sampling and monitoring points, and
show the location of mass (or “congregate”) care facilities that may be
used to shelter evacuees.Ø Maps showing the population distribution around the nuclear facility.Ø Provisions for prot ecting the population residing in a health care or
police custodial facility, or are otherwise confined and who cannot be
evacuated.Ø Coordinating with adjacent jurisdictions and facilities located outside of
the boundaries of the plume exposure pathway  EPZ to facilitate
evacuation.Ø Provisions for contacting the sight - and hearing -impaired.

Nuclear Conflict
The Hazard
Nature of the
Hazard
 The possibility of a nuclear conflict involving the United States is extremely
remote.Our nation's rela tionships with the foreign governments that possess
nuclear weapons remain fluid.The scope of the nuclear conflict threat can vary
from a single accidental launch or detonation by terrorists to a large scale strike
against the United States.Nuclear rad iation is the major effect that is unique to nuclear weapons.The
other effects differ from conventional weapons only in degree.A brief
description of the weapons effects that are of concern to the planner follows.

 iation is the major effect that is unique to nuclear weapons.The
other effects differ from conventional weapons only in degree.A brief
description of the weapons effects that are of concern to the planner follows.

Nuclear
Radiation
Effects    About ha lf of the energy produced in the detonation of a nuclear weapon results
from nuclear fission, a process in which radioactive substances are produced.When detonations occur on or near the earth's surface, the debris produced by
the explosion becomes radio active.Much of this debris is carried high into the
atmosphere by the rising fireball.After the debris cools, it subsequently falls
back to earth in the form of particles commonly  called "fallout."The radiation
emitted from these particles is calle d gamma radiation.The health
consequences of exposure to gamma radiation include:
Ø Radiation sickness .The immediate consequence of human exposure
to gamma radiation is called radiation sickness.The effects may occur
within hours or days following exp osure.Depending on the amount and
duration of exposure, health problems range from nausea, fatigue,
vomiting, diarrhea, loss of hair, hemorrhages, infections, to death.Ø Somatic effects .Radiation injuries that may occur months to years
after exposure a re categorized as somatic effects.They include sterility
or reduced fertility, leukemia, and other forms of cancer.Direct
Weapons The energy released by a nuclear detonation alters the environment in several
ways.In the immediate area of the detonation, the main effects are due to the
Tab 2 to Attachment F:  Nuclear Conflict
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -F-2-2
Effects    blast wave, thermal pulse, and electromagnetic pulse.Ø Blast wave .The force of wind caused by the blast wave destroys or
damages structures and other objects.It propels and spreads the
debris that is cre ated by the explosion.Deaths and injuries result from
people being thrown about or struck by the things that were turned into
projectiles or missiles by the force of the wind associated with the
explosion.Ø Thermal pulse (heat flash) .The thermal pulse ignites exposed
combustible materials, causing many fires.People in the open may be
severely burned by the heat from the detonation.Ø Electromagnetic Pulse .When the radiation energy generated by a
high altitude (60 miles and above) nuclear detonation interacts with the
earth's atmosphere it produces low frequency electromagnetic waves.

 detonation.Ø Electromagnetic Pulse .When the radiation energy generated by a
high altitude (60 miles and above) nuclear detonation interacts with the
earth's atmosphere it produces low frequency electromagnetic waves.

These waves are referred to as the EMP.When EMP interacts with
the electric and electronic equipment components of radio and television
systems, the resulting "energy surge" can cause severe damage.EMP is
not a threat to most people.Only those who rely on an electrically
driven life support system (e.g., pacemaker) are at risk.Risk Area
 The end of the cold war and collapse of the military alliance between th e Soviet
Union and its allies have significantly diminished the possibility of a massive
coordinated attack on the United States.Control of a significant portion of the
former Soviet Union's nuclear arsenal is in the hands of several independent
nations.These nations now chart their own foreign policy and are not obligated
to support any military action in which the new "Russia" may become involved.There are now upwards of twenty nations that may possess the capability to use
nuclear weapons.However , it is unlikely that any one of them possesses or
controls a large enough stockpile of weapons to carry out the kind of massive
attack on the United States that was previously envisioned.Under the current international climate, it is unlikely that an organized  attack on
the United States would occur.However, if an attack did occur, areas
potentially at risk might include:
Tab 2 to Attachment F:  Nuclear Conflict
SLG 101:  Guide for All -Hazard Emergency Operations Planning
(9/96)  page 6 -F-2-3
Ø Military installations that directly  support our nation's nuclear retaliatory
capabilities.Such installations may include inter continental ballistic
missile launch facilities, bases that house fixed wing bombers, and those
that are involved in command and control of offensive nuclear weapons.Ø Large, densely populated metropolitan areas that play a significant role
in support of the nation's governmental or financial management
activities.Nuclear Conflict Unique Planning Considerations

Provisions should be made, as appropriate, to address the following planning
considerations in one or more  appendices to a direction and control annex:
 Ø Coordinating, when appropriate (during an international crisis, U.S.
military intervention overseas, etc.)with the next level of government to
obtain essential information concerning:
• Intelligence estimate  of the intent of adversary nations that
possess weapons of mass destruction.• Appropriate increased readiness actions to take and the timing
for their implementation.Ø Ensuring that personnel with expertise in dealing with hazards associated
with the nuc lear conflict threat are assigned to work in the EOC.Tab 2 to Attachment F:  Nuclear Conflict

Typical tasks may include:
• Advising decision makers on the scope of the radiological
hazards.• Determining when it would be appropriate to distribute
radiological instruments to emergency response or ganizations
and mass care facility management teams.• Disseminating essential radiological information to emergency
response personnel and shelter management teams.• Analyzing radiological information reported by emergency
response teams and facility manag ers.Then:
− Determine the relevant exposure data of shelter
occupants and personnel performing emergency
response duties and ensure that this information is
tracked and recorded.− Implement a procedure that would limit the  exposure of
personnel performin g emergency response duties.− Ensure facilities and areas that must be inhabited or
used by humans are monitored and decontaminated, if
appropriate.− Ensure facilities and areas that are unsafe for human use
are identified.− Ensure people remain sheltered  (in their mass care
facility or risk area shelter) until the gamma radiation
hazard has passed.− Determine the appropriate time to allow evacuees and
the general public to leave mass care facilities

 Warning of the public is a critical functio n related to this hazard.Lead time is
necessary to make the arrangements needed to ensure the people that are
located in risk areas evacuate or seek shelter.

Approximately 48 or more hours
may be needed to carry out the necessary actions to ensure the p ublic is
protected from this hazard.The following planning considerations should be
addressed, if appropriate, in one or more appendices to a warning annex:
Ø Coordination with the next level of government, when appropriate,
(during international crisis, U. S. military intervention overseas, etc.)to
obtain information concerning the appropriate time to disseminate
warning.Ø Use of a jurisdiction -wide warning system to disseminate timely warning
to the public and members of the emergency response organizat ion.Emergency
Public
Information
 A nuclear conflict appendix to an EPI annex should address survival tips for
people living in jurisdictions vulnerable to nuclear effects who choose to shelter
themselves in their homes.Evacuation
 Evacuation is th e primary protective action option that should be used to protect
people from this hazard.The information gained from the risk assessment
should be used to develop the planning instructions that will be relied upon to
carry out an evacuation of those peo ple at risk to direct weapons effects.These planning instructions detail the time -phased actions to be taken to
evacuate people and relocate, if practical, essential services, special custodial
facilities, and government resources from the risk area.Al l actions must be
completed before a nuclear detonation occurs.For this reason, a nuclear
conflict appendix to the evacuation annex should address the clearance times
needed to conduct a safe and timely evacuation of the population at risk.Since a ju risdiction cannot guarantee that it will receive warning in time to
evacuate fully, provisions should be made for relocation within the risk area
of the public at risk in situations where the warning comes too late to permit
evacuation.The following need s should be addressed:
Ø Facilities .Provisions should be made to:
Tab 2 to Attachment F:  Nuclear Conflict

Tornado
The Hazard
Nature of the
Hazard
 A tornado consists of violent whirling wind accompanied by a funnel -shaped
cloud.Usually, tornadoes are associated with severe weather conditions such
as thunderstorms and hurricanes.Tornadoes are very destructive.The
avera ge width of a tornado is 300 to 500 yards.Their path may extend up to
fifty miles, and the funnel cloud moves at speeds between 10 and 50 mph.The
wind speed within the funnel cloud has been estimated at between 100 and 500
mph.Roughly two percent of all tornadoes are "violent" tornadoes, with wind
speeds of 300 mph or more, an average path width of 425 yards, and an
average path length of 26 miles.Tornado season runs from March to August in
the United States, with peak activity from April to June; h owever, tornadoes

 yards, and an
average path length of 26 miles.Tornado season runs from March to August in
the United States, with peak activity from April to June; h owever, tornadoes
can occur year -round.

Risk Area
 Tornadoes have occurred in every State.Historically, they have been most
frequent in Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, South
Dakota, Illinois, Missouri, Mississippi, Louisiana, Colorado , Wisconsin,
Arkansas, Georgia, North Dakota, Minnesota, Indiana, and Michigan.More
than 50 percent of the land mass in the United States is within the area of
significant tornado risk.Tornado Unique Planning Considerations
 This section contains a listing of the functional annexes that typically would
require the preparation of a hazard -specific appendix for tornadoes.It also
identifies many of the unique planning considerations that should be examined by
the planning team and used, as appropriate , when preparing tornado -specific
appendices.Direction and
Control
 For this hazard it is essential for emergency response personnel to take
immediate action, as soon as conditions permit, to gather initial damage
assessment information in the area tha t was impacted by the tornado.This
information is needed to determine the severity and extent of injuries and

damages.High-risk jurisdictions may want to use a network of trained spotters.This
spotting network would be relied on to rapidly communi cate  information that
can be helpful to the appropriate authorities responsible for making the decision
for when to upgrade from a Tornado Watch to Tornado Warning.The
network can also assist in tracking the tornado's path.This data gathering effort should provide much of the information decision
makers will need to implement and prioritize response actions for: search and
rescue activities; access control and re -entry to the impacted area; debris
clearance; restoration of utilities and lifeline repai rs; and the inspection,
condemnation, and/or demolition of buildings and other structures.Provisions should be made, as appropriate, to address the following planning
considerations in one or more appendices to a direction and control annex:
Damage

, and the status of key facilities.

Search and
Rescue
 Use of damage assessment information to identify the facilities and areas where
search and rescue op erations may need to be conducted and to establish a
priority for conduct of these operations.Planning should focus on the actions
that need to be carried out in order to remove trapped and injured persons from
homes, buildings collapses, and other struc tural collapses, administer first aid,
and assist in transporting the seriously injured to medical facilities.Access
Control and
Re-entry
 Control of access to the area severely affected by the tornado until the area is
safe.Only those directly invol ved in emergency response operations should be
allowed to enter.Debris
Clearance
 Actions taken to identify, remove, and dispose of rubble, wreckage, and other
material which block or hamper the performance of emergency response
functions.Activities ma y include:
Ø Demolition and other actions to clear obstructed roads.Attachment H:  Tornado

Demolition  Actions taken to inspect buildings and other structures to determine whether it is
safe to inhabit or use them after a tornado has occurred.Activities may include:
Inspection of buildings and structures which are critical to emergency
operations.Ø Inspection of buildings and structures tha t may threaten public safety.Ø Inspection of less critically damaged structures.Designate those that
may be occupied and identify/mark those that are to be condemned.Ø Arrangements for the demolition of condemned structures.Warning
 Warning of the public is critical for this hazard.The NWS will place areas
under a Tornado Watch when conditions are particularly favorable for
tornadoes and severe storms.NWS will issue a Tornado Warning when a
tornado has been visually spotted or picked up on radar .Television, radio, and
NOAA tone alert radio are sources of  information for the public.

The following planning considerations should be addressed, if appropriate, in
one or more appendices to a warning annex:
Ø Provision for the jurisdiction's central w arning point to obtain timely
Tornado Watch and Warning information (direct link to area weather
stations, continuously monitor NWS and other sources, etc.).Ø Provisions for notifying institutions and facilities (e.g., schools, hospitals,
nursing homes,  jails, prisons, shopping malls, major factories, and
sporting events) that a Watch or Warning has been issued.Attachment H:  Tornado

jurisdiction.Emergency
Public
Information
 The flow of accurate and timely emergency information is critical to the
protection of lives and property.This section deals with the provisions  made to
prepare and disseminate notifications, updates, and instructional messages to
follow up on the initial warning.The following planning considerations should be addressed, if appropriate, in
one or more appendices to an EPI annex:
Ø Survival tips  for people on what to do during and immediately after a
tornado.During a Tornado Watch information should be disseminated
to the public on the appropriate protective actions to take if a Tornado
Warning is issued (e.g., encourage people without undergro und shelter
to seek out an interior room or hallway on the lowest floor and there to
seek cover under something sturdy, like a table, etc.).Ø Warnings and advice on the continuing threat of storms, unsafe areas,
buildings and structures, and other hazards.Evacuation
 Evacuation is not a practical option for this hazard since the point of touchdown
and the track of a tornado are unpredictable.The typical protective action
option for a tornado is shelter -in-place.Mass Care

Chapter 7
Linking Federal and State Emergency Response Operations
Introduction
 The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency As sistance Act, Public
Law 93 -288, as amended, authorizes the Federal Government to respond to
disasters and emergencies in order to provide State and local governments
assistance to save lives and protect public health, safety, and property.The
FRP was de veloped to help expedite Federal support to State and local
governments dealing with the consequences of large -scale disasters (see Figure
7-1).Generally, the FRP is implemented when the State's resources are not
sufficient to cope with a disaster and th e Governor has requested Federal
assistance.This chapter summarizes the response planning considerations that shape the
content of the FRP, Regional Response Plans (RRP), and State EOPs.It also
outlines the linkages between Federal and State emergency response operations
for planning purposes.Relationship - Federal (National/ Regional) Response Plans and the State
EOP
 Federal Response Plans and State EOPs describe each respective level of
government's approach to emergency response operations.Si nce both levels of
government provide support there are some similar and overlapping functions in
the plans.Federal

Functional
Organization
 The FRP uses twelve ESFs to group and describe the kinds of resources and
types of Federal assistance that can be provided  to augment State and local
response efforts.The ESFs include: (1) Transportation, (2) Communications,
(3) Public Works and Engineering, (4) Firefighting, (5) Information and
Planning, (6) Mass Care, (7) Resource Support, (8) Health and Medical
Services,  (9) Urban Search and Rescue, (10) Hazardous Materials, (11) Food,
and (12) Energy.A primary agency has been designated for each ESF.During
response and recovery operations, the primary agency forms and activates a
team that is responsible for working with the appropriate State and local
officials to identify unmet resource needs.The team also coordinates the flow
of resources and assistance the Federal Government provides to meet these
needs.The FRP serves as the foundation for the development of h eadquarters and
regional response plans that will be relied on to implement Federal response
activities.Regional
Response
Plans    RRPs supplement the FRP and detail the specific regional level response and
recovery actions and activities that may be t aken by Federal departments and
agencies to support the Federal response effort.They also provide the
necessary linkage between the State EOP and the FRP.Each RRP:
Ø Specifies the responsibilities that are assigned to each of the tasked
Federal departmen ts and agencies for mobilizing and deploying
resources to assist State(s) in response/recovery efforts.Ø Describes the relationship between the responding Federal
agencies/departments and their State counterparts.Ø Provides information to the States on th e various response mechanisms,
capabilities, and resources available to them through the Federal
Government.Ø Includes organizational tasking and implementing instructions for
accomplishing the actions agreed upon in the Region/State MOUs.The
MOU is a wri tten agreement between the Federal and State
governments.

official are the signatories.The MOU describes the working relationship
and provisions that have been made to facilitate joint Federal/State
operations during large -scale disasters.The following list identifies
some of the typical MOU responsibilities that may be addressed in a
RRP:
• Notification procedures and protocols for communicating with
State officials (points of contact --State Governor,  State
Emergency Management Agency Director, EOC managers,
etc.); means of communication (telephone, radio, teletype, e -
mail, fax, etc.); frequency of contact; and message content
(initial discussions on scope of the disaster, State's initial
assessment of  the situation, identification of liaison officers and
their estimated arrival time at the State EOC, likely staging
areas for Federal response teams, etc.).• Provision for Federal Field Assessment Team (FAsT)
personnel to assist in conduct of a "rapid sit uation assessment"
immediately after a disaster has occurred or immediately prior
to such an event.• The coordination responsibilities of Regional liaison officer(s)
and the provisions established for deployment to the State
EOC.• Provisions for deployment  of emergency response team
members to the State EOC, staging locations, or directly into
the area impacted by the disaster.• Provisions for obtaining work space in the State EOC and other
locations for the initial response cadre, arrangements to obtain
work space for the Disaster Field Office (DFO) and other
follow -on response teams, and a variety of other activities that
require extensive coordination.State
Emergency The State emergency response mission is much broader than the Federa l
Government's.In addition to providing resources to satisfy unmet local needs,

Operations
Plan the State EOP addresses several operational response functions.

 EOP addresses several operational response functions.

These
functions focus on the direction and control, warning, emergency public
information, and evacuation acti ons that must be dealt with during the initial
phase of response operations, fall outside of the Federal response mission, and
are not appropriate for inclusion in Federal response plans.The functional
planning approach suggested in Chapter 5 allows State s to address those
operational responsibilities.Table 7 -1 shows how the functions described in
Chapter 5, if adopted, may link with Federal ESFs in those emergencies that
require implementation of the FRP.(Table 7 -1 is at the end of this chapter,
due to its length.)However, since States do have this additional responsibility to channel Federal
assistance provided under the FRP, some States choose to "mirror" the FRP
functions.There is no need to mirror the Federal ESFs exactly: States have
succes sfully used a hybrid approach, either by giving State counterparts of
Federal ESFs those "extra" responsibilities appropriate to the State level, or by
creating functions in addition to those used by the Federal Government in order
to address State respons ibilities and concerns.The important thing is for the State's choice of  functions to fit the State's own
concept of operations, policies, governmental structure, and resource base.That is because the State EOP details what the State  government will do to
respond to all large -scale disaster and emergency situations that could harm
people and property within the State, whether or not links to the FRP/RRP
framework become necessary.The State EOP:
Ø Identifies the State departments and agencies that hav e been designated
to perform response and recovery activities and specifies the tasks to
be accomplished.Ø Outlines the assistance that may be provided to local jurisdictions during
disaster situations that generate emergency response and recovery
needs be yond the jurisdiction's capabilities to satisfy.

Ø Specifies the direction and control and communications procedures and
systems that will be relied upon to alert, notify, recall, and dispatch
emergency response personnel; warn local jurisdictions; protect  citizens

and property; and request aid/support from other States and/or the
Federal Government (including the role of the Governor’s Authorized
Representative, or GAR).Ø Describes the provisions that have been made to obtain initial situation
assessment i nformation from the local jurisdiction(s) that have been
directly impacted by the disaster.Typically, this information provides
an early assessment of:
• The approximate number of disaster victims that have been:
 − Injured, killed, or are missing.− Evacuated from the area impacted by the disaster.− Housed in mass care facilities.• The damage done to lifeline systems such as hospitals, power
plants, water and sanitation systems, etc.• The damage done to transportation networks such as airports,
major roa ds and bridges, rail lines, ports, etc.• The types of assistance (food, water, medical, US&R, etc.)the
jurisdiction will require to satisfy the immediate needs of disaster
victims.Ø Includes organizational tasking and instructions for accomplishing the
actions agreed upon in the Region/State MOU.The MOU describes
the working relationship and provisions that have been made to facilitate

Glossary of Terms
Words, phrases, abbreviations, and acronyms relevant to emergency management should be defined.Many terms in emergency management have special meanings, so it is important to establish precise
definitions.Such defini tions allow the users of the EOP to share an understanding of the EOP.American Red
Cross  The American Red Cross is a humanitarian organization, led by volunteers, that
provides relief to victims of disasters and helps people prevent, prepare for, and
respond to emergencies.It does this through services that are consistent with its
Congressional Charter and the Principles of the International Red Cross
Movement.Attack

the surface of a structure, area, object, or person.Disaster
 An occurrence of a natural catastrophe, technological accident, or human -
caused event that has resulted in severe property damage, deaths, and/or
multiple injuries.As used in this Guide, a “large -scale disaster” is one that
exceeds the response capability of the local jurisdiction and requires State, and
potentially Federal, involvement.As used in the Stafford Act, a “major
disaster” is “any natural catastrophe [...] or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood,
or explosion, in any part of the United States, which in the determination of the
President causes  damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant major
disaster assistance under [the] Act to supplement the efforts and available
resources or States, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in
alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, o r suffering caused thereby.”

zone (with a 50 -mile radius centered at the nuclear power plant)
for which plans are developed to protect the public from the
ingestion of water or foods contaminated as the result of a
nuclear power plant accident.Ø In CSEPP, the EPZ is divided into three concentric circular zones:
• Immediate Response Zone  (IRZ) .A circular zone ranging from
10 to 15 km (6 to 9 miles) from the potential chemical event
source, depending on the stockpile location on -post.Emergency response plans  developed for the IRZ must provide
for the most rapid and effective protective actions possible,
since the IRZ will have the highest concentration of agent and
the least amount of warning time.• Protective Action Zone (PAZ) .An area that extends beyon d
the IRZ to approximately 16 to 50 km (10 to 30 miles) from the
stockpile location.The PAZ is that area where public protective
actions may still be necessary in case of an accidental release of
chemical agent, but where the available warning and respons e
time is such that most people could evacuate.However, other
responses (e.g., sheltering) may be appropriate for institutions
and special populations that could not evacuate within the
available time.• Precautionary Zone (PZ) .The outermost portion of th e EPZ
for CSEPP, extending from the PAZ outer boundary to a
distance where the risk of adverse impacts to humans is
negligible.Because of the increased warning and response time
available for implementation of response actions in the PZ,
detailed local em ergency planning is not required, although
consequence management planning may be appropriate.

HURRICANE PREPAREDNESS GUIDE
Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Division3
Dear Fellow Floridians,
As we approach another hurricane season, I am writing to you with an urgent reminder:
preparedness saves lives.With the unpredictability of nature, it is crucial that we equip
ourselves with the knowledge and resources to protect our families, homes and communities.Last year, the 2023 Atlantic Hurricane season tied as the fourth most active season on record
with 20 named storms, including seven hurricanes.That is why I am pleased to present the 2024 Hurricane Preparedness Guide .This comprehensive resource is designed to assist Floridians throughout every step of the
preparation journey, from pre-storm readiness to post-storm recovery.The guide contains
invaluable information, including:
• Preparation:  Learn how to assemble an emergency kit and secure a home to mitigate
potential damage;
• Planning:  Develop a family emergency plan to ensure everyone knows what to do and
where to go when a hurricane strikes;
• Guidance:  Benefit from practical tips and guidelines to stay informed with the latest
weather forecasts and emergency alerts; and
• Post-Storm Recovery:  Access essential resources and contacts for navigating the
recovery process and rebuilding a community.In addition to practical tips and guidelines, the guide also includes important contact
information for emergency services and local authorities.It is a must-have resource for every
Floridian, whether a longtime resident or new to our beautiful state.Remember, preparedness
is a shared responsibility.By taking proactive steps to prepare ourselves and our communities,
we can minimize the impact of hurricanes and ensure a faster recovery process.

is a shared responsibility.By taking proactive steps to prepare ourselves and our communities,
we can minimize the impact of hurricanes and ensure a faster recovery process.

I encourage everyone to review the 2024 Hurricane Preparedness Guide  thoroughly and
take action now to safeguard families and properties.Together, we can weather any storm that
comes our way.Stay safe Florida,
       Ashley Moody
       Attorney General
HURRICANE PREPAREDNESS GUIDE
Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Division4LIST OF STORM NAMES FOR 2024
The World Meteorological Organization Hurricane Committee maintained the June 1 start date to the
Atlantic hurricane season.However, in several recent years, a named storm has formed prior to the
official start date.The tradition of naming tropical storms started in 1953—since then 96 names have
been retired due to their particularly destructive nature.The 2024 list includes the following names:
• Alberto
• Beryl
• Chris
• Debby
• Ernesto
• Francine
• Gordon• Helene
• Isaac
• Joyce
• Kirk
• Leslie
• Milton
• Nadine• Oscar
• Paty
• Rafael
• Sara
• Tony
• Valerie
• William
In the event that more than twenty-one named tropical cyclones occur in the Atlantic basin in a
season, any additional storms will take names from an alternate list of names approved by the WMO
located at www.nhc.noaa.gov .HURRICANE PREPAREDNESS GUIDE

A Hurricane Watch  means hurricane conditions (sustained winds of at least 74 mph) are possible in
the announced area within 48 hours.

 Attorney General Consumer Protection Division8UNDERSTANDING THE STORM
WATCH VERSUS WARNING
A Hurricane Watch  means hurricane conditions (sustained winds of at least 74 mph) are possible in
the announced area within 48 hours.

A Hurricane Watch should trigger your family’s disaster plan, and proactive measures should be
initiated such as securing a boat, leaving a barrier island, etc.A Hurricane Warning  means hurricane conditions (sustained winds of at least 74 mph) are expected
in the announced area within 36 hours.Once a Hurricane Warning has been issued, your family should be in the process of completing
proactive actions and moving to the safest location to be during the storm.THE SAFFIR-SIMPSON HURRICANE WIND SCALE
This scale estimates potential property damage.Hurricanes reaching Category 3 and higher are
considered major hurricanes because of their potential for significant loss of life and damage.Category 1 and 2 storms are still dangerous, however, and also require preventative measures.Category 1
(74-95 mph winds)Dangerous winds will produce some damage.The damage is
primarily contained to shrubbery, trees, foliage and unanchored
homes; damage to roof, shingles, vinyl siding and gutters could
result.Category 2
(96-110 mph winds)Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage.Considerable damage to shrubbery and tree foliage; some trees
blown down.Major damage to exposed mobile homes.Some
damage to roofing materials of buildings; some window damage.No major damage to buildings.Category 3
(111-129 mph winds)Devastating damage will occur.Large trees blown down.Major damage to and removal of roof; some window and door
damage.Some structural damage to small buildings.Mobile
homes destroyed.Serious flooding at coast and many structures
near coast destroyed; larger structures near coast damaged by
battering waves and loose debris.Category 4
(130-156 mph winds)Catastrophic damage will occur.Severe damage to roofing
materials, windows, doors and exterior walls.Complete failures
of roofs on many small residences.Complete destruction of
mobile homes.Major damage to lower floors of structures near
shore due to flooding and battering by waves and debris.Most of
the area will be uninhabitable for weeks or months.Category 5
(157+ mph winds)Catastrophic damage will occur.A high percentage of framed
homes will be destroyed.Complete failure of roofs on many
residences and industrial buildings.Extensive shattering of glass
in windows and doors.Small buildings overturned or blown away.

Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Division9PREPARING FOR THE STORM
In anticipation of a storm, it is important to ensure that you have done everything you can to prepare
your home, property or business.Strengthen your home.Declutter drains and gutters.Bring in outside furniture, garden décor
and lawn ornaments.Trim trees and loose foliage prior to storm season.Consider boarding windows with plywood or purchasing hurricane shutters.Hurricane shutters.Approved hurricane shutters and impact protective systems can offer
protection for your home or business.Not all hurricane shutters or
impact protective systems meet the standards set by the Florida
Building Commission or your local building authority.For the Florida
Building Commission to approve a product designed for a window, the
product must be part of the complete window system and assembly.Window films and related products, which are typically attached only to
the frame of a window, do not protect the window against windstorms.Ensure you are buying a quality product:
• Ask to see the product approval by the Florida Building Commission or local building
authority.Visit FloridaBuilding.org  to verify the approval number supplied.Note:  Be aware that some products may have been tested by a lab that is accredited by the
Florida Building Commission or Miami Dade County, but that does not mean the product
is an approved form of storm protection.Test results for a product may refer to the lab’s
accreditation, but this is not equivalent to a product approval.• Check with your city or county to determine whether you need a permit to install the
products on your home; in most cases, a permit will not be issued without proper
documentation of the product approval.• Report any company that is making fraudulent claims about window film or other
unapproved products by calling the Attorney General’s hotline at 1-866-9-NO-SCAM .• Know that your insurance provider may provide discounts for hurricane mitigation.HURRICANE PREPAREDNESS GUIDE

and wind-borne debris that can damage vehicles.

NESS GUIDE
Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Division10Protect your car.A tropical storm or hurricane can produce devastating flooding
and wind-borne debris that can damage vehicles.

In order to
protect your vehicles, consider the following tips:
• Park in a safe location.Store your car inside a garage if
possible.If a garage is unavailable, park your car close
to a building and avoid parking under power lines or
trees.Move your car to a higher elevation if you live in a
floodplain.• Fill your car’s gas tank before the storm so if you need
to evacuate or get help after the storm, you will have
enough gas to do so.• Remove non-essential items from your car’s exterior.• Store important car documents safely in a plastic bag and
take photos of your car’s interior and exterior to provide
to your insurance company in the event damage occurs.• Avoid driving in a flood.It is often difficult to tell how
deep a puddle may be; even one foot of standing water
can damage your car.Determine what to do with pets.Whether you decide to evacuate or stay in your home, you will
need to make plans in advance for your pets.Not all emergency
shelters accept pets, so it is important to do your research in
advance to find out where the pet-friendly shelters are located
near you.Put together a pet disaster supply kit that includes
medications, medical records, a first aid kit, sturdy leashes and/or
carriers, food and water.Protect your neighbors.If you live near senior adults or those who may need additional
help, check in with your neighbors to see if they would like
assistance securing hurricane plans, gathering supplies or
preparing their homes for the hurricane season.Don’t forget about your business.Tropical storms and hurricanes can impact organizations.It is
important to understand the risks and potential impacts in order
to prepare accordingly.Experts estimate that 75 percent of
businesses without a continuity plan will fail within three years of
a disaster.HURRICANE PREPAREDNESS GUIDE
Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Division11PREPAREDNESS CHECKLIST
Complete this checklist to ensure your home and belongings are as protected as possible before a
storm event hits.q Close and lock your windows.q Inspect each window and door and reseal if necessary.q If your doors could use some additional reinforcing, purchase and install a bolt
kit from a hardware store.

kit from a hardware store.

q Bring all outdoor furniture, decor and children’s toys inside.q In advance of hurricane season, trim any tree branches that are breaking, dead
or near windows or your roof.Once a storm is threatening your area, trimming
is discouraged as debris may not be picked up and can become projectiles
during a storm.q Clean out your gutters.q Store any valuables in waterproof containers.q Turn your refrigerator and freezer to their highest settings as a precaution to
eliminate food waste due to power outage.q Find a “safe zone” in your home.q Move your hurricane supplies to your “safe zone.”

Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Division14PRICE GOUGING
Those affected by a natural disaster can unfortunately become victims of bad-acting businesses
and individuals out to profit from the misfortune of others.Florida has a tough price gouging law
designed to protect its residents and guests from becoming victims for a second time during or after
a disaster.The law bans unconscionable increases in prices in the rental or sale of essential commodities such
as lumber, ice, water, generators and shelter in the area affected by the emergency once a State of
Emergency has been declared by the governor.Under price gouging laws, it is also unlawful to raise
rental rates for hotel stays or other housing necessary for use as a direct result of an emergency.The Florida Office of the Attorney General investigates every allegation of price gouging.

 an emergency.The Florida Office of the Attorney General investigates every allegation of price gouging.

The law
requires the Attorney General’s Office to compare the reported price of the essential commodity or
service during the declared State of Emergency to the average price during the 30-day period prior
to the declaration.If there is a “gross disparity” between the prior price and the current charge,
it is considered price gouging unless the seller can show that a price increase was attributable to
an increase in the costs incurred to provide the commodity or to market trends.The price gouging
statute does not apply to non-essential luxury goods like alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.Violators of the price gouging statute are subject to civil penalties of $1,000 per violation and up to
a total of $25,000 for multiple violations committed in a single 24-hour period, in addition to other
penalties that may be imposed for violations of related laws.AVOID BECOMING A VICTIM OF PRICE GOUGING
The best method to avoid price gouging is to plan ahead.Prepare for a
disaster before it happens, so you have the supplies you need on hand.By creating a disaster preparedness kit that contains non-perishable
supplies such as batteries, generators, canned goods, bottled water
etc.needed for the storm season prior to June 1st , not only will you
diminish the opportunity to be price gouged on an item, but you
may also avoid long lines or shortages that may leave you without a
necessary item as a named storm approaches.If you suspect price gouging, obtain as much information as possible
in the form of estimates, invoices, receipts, pictures or bills.When
comparing products, note as much detailed information as possible,
including the product name, size or quantity, manufacturer or brand,
item number and price.For lumber, note the grade, thickness, quantity
and quality.If you have purchased similar items at the same business
prior to the storm, providing information about the prior purchase,
including the date of the prior purchase and the price paid, may be very
useful.Report this information to the Attorney General’s Office by downloading
the free smartphone application, “No Scam”, to submit a complaint.The
app is available in both Apple and Android stores in English and Spanish.

Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Division16SCAMS AT A GLANCE: AFTER THE STORM
Every emergency or natural disaster brings out unscrupulous individuals who seek to take advantage
of the crisis and prey on those in distress.The following scams are among the most prevalent during
these times:
BUILDING REPAIR AND CONTRACTING SCAMS
Qualified contractors are in high demand following a disaster, making conditions ideal for scam
artists.If your home is in need of repair, be sure to follow these tips when hiring a contractor:
• Be wary of anyone who approaches you unsolicited or says they can perform your repairs at
a discount with leftover supplies from another job.• Have your insurance company evaluate the damage before arranging repairs to ensure that
the work will be covered under your policy.• Get at least three written, itemized estimates or bids on repairs.• Verify that the contractor has a license from the Department of Business & Professional
Regulation or your county construction licensing board.A licensed contractor can be looked
up and verified at MyFloridaLicense.com .• Beware of companies/individuals who only produce an occupational license or a corporate
filing when you request information regarding the business.These documents only prove
that certain funds were paid to the government.• Research the company and its reputation – ask for references.In addition to DBPR, you may
also contact the Attorney General’s hotline by calling 1-866-9-NO-SCAM  and the Better
Business Bureau at bbb.org  to see if there are complaints against the company.• Check for proof of insurance, preferably general liability and worker’s compensation
insurance, and verify with the insurer that their policies are current.• Ensure the contractor is bonded and verify with the bonding agency.While not required,
bonding adds another layer of protection for consumers.• Be wary of anyone offering to reduce or rebate your homeowner’s insurance policy
deductible in exchange for using their services.Florida law prohibits contractors from
paying, waiving or rebating any part of a deductible on repairs made to property covered by
an insurance policy.

 for using their services.Florida law prohibits contractors from
paying, waiving or rebating any part of a deductible on repairs made to property covered by
an insurance policy.

• Never pay the full amount of a repair up front and hesitate before providing any large
deposits.Florida law requires a contractor to apply for a permit within 30 days and start
work within 90 days if he collects more than 10 percent of the contract up front.• Read the entire contract, including the fine print before signing and ensure that the contract
includes the required “buyer’s right to cancel” (within 3 days) language.• Do not sign any document through an electronic device unless you have time to review the
entire document first.You may wish to request a hard copy of the document to allow time
for a complete review of the terms.• Homeowners may unknowingly have liens placed against their properties by suppliers or
subcontractors who have not been paid by the contractor.If the contractor fails to pay them,
the liens will remain on the title.Insist on releases of any liens that could be placed on the
property from all subcontractors prior to making final payments.• Do not sign a certificate of completion or make final payment until you are satisfied with the
work performed.HURRICANE PREPAREDNESS GUIDE
Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Division17ASSIGNMENT OF BENEFITS ISSUES
An Assignment of Benefits (AOB) is a document that allows insurance policyholders to sign over
their insurance rights or benefits to a third party after the policyholder suffers a loss.This allows
the third party to file an insurance claim, make repair decisions and collect on benefits without
the policyholder’s involvement.While AOBs can offer convenience to policyholders attempting to
navigate the insurance claims process, unscrupulous individuals and companies may seek to take
advantage of the power an AOB provides them.If your home is damaged, keep the following in mind
as you seek to make repairs:
• Be aware that Florida law recently changed and now prohibits the assignment of post-
insurance benefits for any policy written after January 1, 2023.• Contact your insurance company prior to signing the AOB.You may find a list of contact
numbers for insurance companies at https://floir.com/consumers/assignment-of-benefits-
resources .• Know that you are not required to sign an AOB in order to have repairs made or to process an
insurance claim.

ignment-of-benefits-
resources .• Know that you are not required to sign an AOB in order to have repairs made or to process an
insurance claim.

• Know that the AOB agreement must contain a written, itemized, per-unit cost estimate of the
services to be performed under the agreement.• Be wary of any company that pressures you to sign or insists upon the use of an AOB in order
to do repairs.• Read the entire contract carefully to ensure you are not signing over your benefits without
your full knowledge and consent.Some unscrupulous contractors may attempt to hide an
AOB within a lengthy repair contract.• Know that an AOB contains language that, once executed, would prevent you from
communicating with your insurance company about the claim.• Do not sign an AOB if there are blank spaces in the document.• Know that legislation that became effective July 1, 2019, allows new AOBs to be rescinded
within 14 days of execution of the AOB.• Know that this 2019 legislation also allowed new AOBs to be rescinded at least 30 days after
the scheduled work start date if the assignee has not begun substantial work.Or if no start
date is listed, a new AOB can be rescinded at least 30 days following the execution date if
the assignee has not begun substantial work.TREE SERVICE SCAMS
Heavy winds from a hurricane or tropical storm can litter roads and yards with uprooted trees.If you
plan to have nearby trees removed to protect your home from danger or have fallen trees needing to
be removed after a storm, follow these tips to avoid problems when hiring a tree removal service:
• Be wary of anyone who approaches you unsolicited about tree removal.• Get multiple written estimates and ask whether debris removal is included in the estimate.• Research the company and its reputation – ask for references, contact the Attorney General’s
hotline at 1-866-9-NO-SCAM  and the Better Business Bureau online at bbb.org  to see if
there are complaints against the company.Contact the state Department of Business &
Professional Regulation’s website at MyFloridaLicense.com  to see if the company is licensed.• Check for proof of insurance and verify with the insurer that their policy is current.• Never pay the full amount up front and do not make a final payment until you are completely
satisfied with the work done.

Office of the Attorney General Consumer Protection Division18CHARITY SCAMS
Charity scams are particularly effective after a disaster, during which numerous disaster-specific
charities crop up.If you would like to donate to help with disaster relief, consider these tips:
• Avoid solicitors that use high-pressure tactics or are hesitant to provide additional
information on the charitable organization.• Be wary of any unsolicited calls, texts, emails or social media messages soliciting donations.• Consider donating to an established disaster-relief charity.• Obtain a copy of the charity’s registration documents from the Florida Department
of Agriculture and Consumer Services at 1-800-HELP-FLA (1-800-435-7352)  or
FDACS.gov/ConsumerServices .• Contact the Attorney General’s hotline by calling 1-866-9-NO-SCAM  or call the Better
Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance at 703-276-0100  to determine if the charity you are
donating to has any complaints against them.DISASTER RELIEF SCAMS
FEMA offers disaster relief to eligible victims through various programs.When seeking aid, consider
the following:
• No state or federal disaster relief agency will call you for your financial information.• State and federal workers carry identification and will not ask for or accept cash or gift cards.• Know that applications for federal FEMA relief programs are free and can be accessed at
DisasterAssistance.gov  or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (1-800-621-3362) .• Be wary of anyone who offers to fill out, assist with or expedite your application as they may
be seeking access to your personal information.WATER TESTING AND TREATMENT SCAMS
Water mains and personal wells can be affected during hurricanes, and dishonest companies and
individuals may offer pricey tests and devices to make water safe.Avoid falling victim by following
these tips:
• If someone claims to be a representative of your city, county or utility provider needing to
inspect your water line or well, ask for proof of identification.Consider calling the agency
directly to confirm if the representative is legitimate.• Avoid “free” water tests as the tester is likely only interested in selling their water treatment
device.

.Consider calling the agency
directly to confirm if the representative is legitimate.• Avoid “free” water tests as the tester is likely only interested in selling their water treatment
device.

If you are in need of a water quality test, seek information on qualified testing
laboratories from the Florida Department of Health at 850-245-4444 .• Watch your local media for any water safety alerts.If you doubt the safety of your water,
contact your local health department or utility.Local water utilities are required to test
water quality on a regular basis.• If in doubt, boil water vigorously for one to three minutes or drink bottled water.Anyone who encounters a scam before or after a hurricane or other natural disaster should

General Requirements:
The session involves discussion of  both earthquake response and r ecovery operations.Objectives
11.1 – 11.6 cover the topic of response , and Objectives 11.7 - 11.10 discuss recovery  activities.The concept of disaster respons e and recovery already has been  introduced to the student in
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-3 earlier discussions, especially in  Session 8 where the four disast er phases were presented in a
general manner.The instructor should repeat th is and explain that this session will focus on
issues associated specifically with earthquake disasters .There also will be overlap with other
sessions, e.g., Session 7, in which earthquakes e ffects were discussed, and we saw that key
lifelines, such as major transportation routes, were likely be damaged, even in moderate earthquakes.Such disruption obviously will pose  severe impediments to both response and
recovery operations.

 even in moderate earthquakes.Such disruption obviously will pose  severe impediments to both response and
recovery operations.

This session also will ove rlap with Session 14, which will cover earthquake
planning, as planning is involved with all phases and aspects of  earthquake disasters.Such
overlap is purposeful and advantageous in that  the most important issues hopefully will be re-
emphasized.The students should be encouraged to make the connections among the various
sessions and discuss them.The instructor should begin this session by defining and discussing earthquake disaster
response .It is important to discuss differences be tween response to earthquake disasters and
other hazards, such as floods or hurricanes (i .e., earthquakes occur with no warning).The
instructor should present key i ssues that promote improved disa ster response and, conversely,
discuss major challenges and impediments to re sponse.A classroom discussion assignment is
included and should be handed out  following the end of the discussion of earthquake response
(Objective 11.6).The assignment i nvolves a role-playing exercise to be completed by teams of
students in which they will be required to c onsider actions and issues faced by emergency
managers.Following the discussion on disaster response, the lecture should transition to earthquake disaster
recovery, beginning with Objectiv e 11.7.The general approach used to discuss earthquake
response should be used to presen t earthquake recovery.That is, earthquake disaster recovery
should be defined, and then key issues, impedime nts, and deficiencies presented and discussed.A homework assignment is included and should be  distributed at the e nd of the session.One
week should be allowed for completion.Electronic visual images presente d in these notes are
included in the accompanying file: Session 11 Electronic Visuals.ppt._____________________________________________________________________________

A.Disaster response activi ties typically include:
[Instructor note : The following categories will be cover ed and discussed in detail during
the in-class discussion assi gnment to be covered at the end of Objective 11.6 ]
1.Rapid damage assessment.2.Search and rescue.3.Emergency medical care.4.Emergency restoration of essential services.5.Fire-fighting.6.Emergency communications.7.Crisis decision-making.8.Evacuation, protection of lives and property.9.The provision of emergency shelter for victims.10.Debris removal (also asso ciated with recovery).11.Other activities that take place during the immediate post-impact
emergency period.B.Disaster response also includes the implementation of disaster preparedness
plans and procedures , thus overlapping with disaster preparedness .C. Response activities must address the need to deal with both event-generated
demands  (i.e., problems directly created by th e disaster agent itself, such as
injuries and physical damage) and response-generated challenges  (i.e., the need
for rapid situation assessment and for information on which to base decisions; MCEER, 2000).II.The federal government, all states, and virt ually all communities in the United States
have plans for responding to major disasters , including earthquakes, although both
the quality of these planning efforts and th e demonstrated capacity to respond to
major disasters varies considerably nationwide.A.Because major disasters, such as a ca tastrophic earthquake in an urban area,
initially overwhelm available resources , perhaps the most significant challenge
facing affected communities in the imme diate post-impact period is accurate
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-5 assessment of the situation and priori tization of response needs (MCEER,
2000).B.A primary difference between responding to earthquake  events and other natural
disasters is that  earthquakes occur without warning and tend to affect a
widespread area even if the event is  moderate.Also, earthquakes affect
above- and below- ground lifelines, a nd buried utilities and communication
systems are more likely to be damaged during these events.III.

 earthquakes affect
above- and below- ground lifelines, a nd buried utilities and communication
systems are more likely to be damaged during these events.III.

Fast, reliable damage assessment during earthqu akes is vital, but is extremely difficult,
particularly in large disaster earthquakes , as summarized in the following excerpt
from MCEER’s Strategic Plan (2000):
In the 1995 Kobe earthquake, for example, the response was delayed and significant
problems developed due to government’s inab ility to evaluate the scope and severity
of earthquake impacts and to mobilize resources.The same kinds of problems
occurred in the United States following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, when government
officials lacked timely, accurate data on the extent and location of damage, and as a
result, were slow to recogni ze the hurricane’s near-catastrophic effects.Such problems
could have been overcome had there been systems in place to rapidly detect damage and disruption on both macro and micro s cales while surmounting the enormous
communications and transporta tion disruptions those disast ers produced (MCEER, 2000).Such systems currently do not exist,  either in the US or elsewhere.To avoid repeating
these experiences in the next major nation al disaster, advanced damage-detection
methods are needed, and data on damage and other impacts must be incorporated into effective crisis decision support systems.A.Thus, early warning systems  (such as TriNet and ShakeMaps used for early
warning as discussed previously in Se ssion 6) and damage assessment/prediction
tools (GPS, GIS mapping systems) that predict and illustrate probable
damages from a number of disaster s cenarios are critically important.B.One key to enhancing the effectivene ss of response and recovery activities is
promoting the adoption and use of technologies e.g., remote-sensing
technologies for rapid post-event damage assessment and loss estimation) that
would enable the organizations responsib le for coordinating those activities
to deal with earthquake-related proble ms in a timely manner and to make
decisions that are based on empirical data and sound management principles
(MCEER, 2000).Objective 11.2 List the ge neral objectives of eart hquake emergency response.Requirements:

etc.)and restoration of lifelines are essential  (MCEER, 2000; NRC, 2003).III.Inspection and condemnation of damaged infrastructure (especially unstable
structures that may be dangerous due to  aftershocks) and emergency/temporary
repairs should be made where feasible.IV.In cases involving population displacements an d temporary housing, the aim is to find
durable solutions as quickly as possible , while ensuring protection and assistance as
necessary in the meantime.V. Accomplish all of the abo ve in a “sustainable” manner  that contributes to long-term

The content should be presented as lecture.Remarks:
I.Specific  activities associated with earthquake emergency response:
 [Note: The portion of the following was adapted from the Church World Service
Emergency Response Training Course Manual (CWT/ACT, 2004)]
A.Early Warning – Early warning  refers to arrangements to rapidly disseminate
information concerning imminent eart hquake motion threats to government
officials, institutions, and the population at  large in the areas at immediate risk.These warnings normally are generated by new systems such as TriNet, discussed in Session 6.While the warning system s only begin when earthquake shaking
starts, it may allow actions such as moving to safer locations or shutting off of gas
lines, etc.as the earthquake begins.Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-7 B. Evacuation/migration – Evacuation involves the relo cation of a population from
zones at risk of an imminent  disaster to a safer location, especially if structures are
susceptible to damage from aftershock.

 Evacuation involves the relo cation of a population from
zones at risk of an imminent  disaster to a safer location, especially if structures are
susceptible to damage from aftershock.

C. Search and rescue – Search and rescue (SAR), is the process of identifying the
location of disaster victims who may be tr apped or isolated and bringing them to
safety and medical attention.In the aftermath of earthquakes, SAR normally
focuses on locating people who are trappe d and injured in collapsed buildings.D. Post-disaster assessment – The primary objective of assessment is to provide a
clear, concise picture of the post-disaster situation, to identify relief needs, and to
develop strategies for recovery.It determ ines options for humanitarian assistance,
how best to utilize existing resources, or to develop requests fo r further assistance.The post-disaster assessment must di stinguish among pre-disaster chronic
conditions, the needs of disaster survivors and thei r resources.E. Emergency relief – Emergency relief is the provision, on a humanitarian basis, of
material aid and emergency medical care necessary to save and preserve human
lives.It also enables families to meet their basic needs for medical and health
care, shelter, clothing, water, and food (including the means to prepare food).Relief supplies or services typically are pr ovided, free of charge, in the days and
weeks immediately following a sudden disaster.F. Logistics and supply – The delivery of emergency relief will require logistical
facilities and capacity.A well- organized supply service is  crucial for handling the
procurement or donation, storage, and dispat ch of relief supplies for distribution to
disaster victims.G. Communication and information management – All of the above activities are
dependent on communication.There are tw o key aspects to communications in
disasters.1.The equipment essential for informa tion flow, such as radios, telephones,
and their supporting systems of repeat ers, satellites, and transmission
lines.2.The information management,that is, the protocol of knowing who
communicates what information to whom, what priority is given to it, and
how it is disseminated and interpreted.H. Survivor response and coping – In the rush to plan and execute a relief operation,
it is easy to overlook the real needs and resources of the survivors.1.The assessment must take into account existing social coping mechanisms
that negate the need to br ing in outside assistance.Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery

On the other hand, disaster survivor s may have new and special needs for
social services to help adjust to the trauma and disruption caused by the
disaster.3.Participation in the disaster res ponse process by individuals to aid
community organizations is a key to  healthy recovery.Through them,
appropriate coping mechanisms will be most successfully utilized.I.Security – Security is not always a priority  issue after sudde n onset natural
disasters.Typically, it is handled by civil defense or police departments.J.Emergency operations management – None of the above activities can be
implemented without some degree of  emergency operations management.Policies and procedures for management re quirements need to be established well
in advance of the disaster.K. Rehabilitation and reconstruction – Rehabilitation and rec onstruction complete
the disaster response activities and merge with the recovery phase.II.Most communities with an emergency  response plan for earthquake disasters
include the following categories in the response plan:
[Instructor note : The following categories will be cover ed and discussed in detail during

Objective 11.5 List typical deficienci es in earthquake emergency response.Requirements:
The content should be presented as lecture.Remarks:
I.Emergency management and response sy stems continue to improve with each
earthquake; however, systems can be strengthened further through greater
collaboration and partnership with and between public, private, non-profit
agencies, and the community (Californi a Seismic Safety Commission [CSSC],
2003).According to CSSC, typical deficienci es in most communiti es still exist in:
A.Resources needed for better co mmunication during an event.B.Resources in and coordination between the public and private medical response
systems.C. Resources for sustained sear ch and rescue operations.D. Adequate and sustained resources for em ergency management at all levels of
government.E. Most importantly, reliable and timel y damage assessment and decision support
systems to accelerate and optimize response ac tivities.In fact, this deficiency is
important enough to focus on and list severa l impediments to the development of
knowledge and technologies that improve our ability to reliably and quickly assess
damage and optimize response resources:
1.

The proprietary and/or classified natu re of the software and data needed
for rapid post-earthquake loss estimation is another barrier that must be
surmounted in order to conduct basic research and move toward the development of enabling technologie s. Many remote-sensing technologies
have been developed for intelligence and defense purposes, and it is only recently that their use in hazard management has been considered.2.The difficulties with developing comple te inventories of elements in the
built environment that are at risk in  order to validate advanced damage
assessment models constitute yet another set of barriers to research progress.Inventory development is cu mbersome and expensive, and data
sources that typically serve as the basis for inventories, such as tax
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-12 assessor’s records, do not take into account all at-risk structures and
facilities.3.Recovery decision modeling likewise is hampered by a lack of
comprehensive models that account for regional social and economic
earthquake impacts and a shortage of  data from which to construct
recovery decision support models.4.Implementation also is more difficu lt because of the inability of many
governmental entities to take advant age of new emergency and recovery
management tools due, for example, to lack of funds and trained personnel.11.6 Describe innovative tools that are being de veloped to assist in response efforts.Requirements:
The contents should be presente d as lecture.The class discus sion assignment (Handout 11.1)
should be conducted following this objective.[Instructor note : Some of this material will  also be discussed in fu ture sessions (i.e., Session 14) ]
 Handouts Included:    Handout 11.1: Classroom Discussion Assignment
Remarks:
I. Geographical information systems (GIS ) are organized collections of hardware,
software, geographic data, and personnel data designed to efficiently capture, store,
update, manipulate, analyze, and display all forms of geographically referenced
information.A.These systems can be used with se ismic models to forecast damages for
earthquake scenarios and display the results in graphical format, such as digitized
color maps.B.Such data are extremely valuable for timely decision-making given a hazard
event.

event.

C. Some of these systems can be combined with early-warning systems to create an
almost real-time graphical display of the shaking effects in a particular region.II.Global Positioning Systems (GPS)   are navigational systems involving satellites and
computers that can determine the latitude  and longitude of a receiver on Earth by
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-13 computing the time difference for signals fr om different satellites to reach the
receiver.A.Remote sensing via satellite and grou nd level (and subsurface) sensing via
seismographs brings real-time warnings of quakes and their related hazards.B. GPS technology can detect land movement  by monitoring changes in the position
of ground-based stations monitored by sa tellites.Satellite imagery, GPS, and
computer models also are leading to better land-use practices.C. For example, the World Bank is planning to  assist countries such as Honduras and
Turkey with a credit that will finance mapping of vulnerable areas, using GPS technology to help develop effective m onitoring systems to forecast natural
hazards, including earthquakes, and to plan appropriate land use.III.Infrastructure and asset management  system  is an operational package that enables
the systematic coordinated planning and programming of investments or
expenditure, design, construction, mainte nance, rehabilitation and renovation,
operation, and in-service evaluation of physi cal facilities.The system usually is a
computer-based database of facilities.Thes e tools can be used in earthquake hazard
operations to:
A.Minimize costs.B.Maximize benefits.C. Maximize safety.D. Minimize disturbance to daily life.E. Minimize response time.[Instructor note : conduct classroom discussion using Handout 11.1 ]
Objective 11.7 Define disaster recovery and discuss major concepts associated with
earthquake disaster recovery.Requirements:

Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-14
Remarks:  I.Recovery  is the phase of earthquake management  that aims to restore communities
affected by disasters to a normal regime of social and economic activity.It involves
not only repairing or replacing physi cal infrastructure damaged during an
earthquake, but also rebuilding the econo mic strength and social stability of a
community through appropriate fi nancial and regulatory programs.II.Recovery activities consist of actions ta ken to return to (or, ideally, exceed) pre-
earthquake levels of activity and productivity.A.These actions include restori ng, repairing, and reconstructing lifelines and
buildings , undertaking measures to overc ome earthquake-induced economic
downturns, and providing fi nancial assistance to co mpensate for losses.As discussed earlier in Session 7 re garding the effects of earthquakes upon
lifelines, transportation systems have an esp ecially large impact on both the
response and recovery efforts .Damage to transportation systems is
particularly important because the repai r times for these systems typically is
much longer than for other life lines, as shown in the visuals (see Chang,
2000).[Visuals 11.1, 11.2, 11.3]
Visual 11.1 – Photo of upper deck of Oakland Bay Bridge that slipped off its bearing seat
during the 1989 Loma Prieta EQ.This was a moderate structural failure (inadequate beam
seat width), but the disruption in the Bay area  was severe.More than one month was required

repair times.Visual from Chang (2000).Visual 11.3 – Collapsed upper deck of the Cy press Freeway due to 1989 Loma Prieta
Earthquake .

The earthquake destroyed a 1¼-mile section of Interstate 880 .This was a major
artery in the Oakland-Alameda area ea st of San Francisco.The poor seismic
performance of this freeway promoted the en tire 5.2 mile-long section to be rebuilt.This
project was very expensive ($1.2 billion) and was not completed until September 1998,
nearly nine years after the earthquake (F HWA, 2004).Photo credit: CalTrans.Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-16 B.The recovery period typically is the ti me in which decisions are made about
adopting new mitigation measures with the long-term objective of increasing
the earthquake resistance of the built environment  (Mileti, 1999).III.If undertaken properly, recovery stra tegies can contain indirect and induced
earthquake losses, shorten the recovery period for affected social units, and avoid
future losses through improvements in mitigation (Mileti, 1999).IV.Earthquake disaster recovery  involves long-term efforts to:
A. Reconstruct and restore the earthquake-stricken area , e.g.through repairing
or replacing homes, businesses, pub lic works, and other structures.B.Deal with the disruption that the disaster has caused  in community life and
meet the recovery-related needs of victims.C. Mitigate future hazards .V. Although the four disaster phases (p reparedness, mitigation, response, and
recovery) may appear to be stages in a seque nce, they actually overlap and merge.For example,  decisions that have an impact on ea rthquake recovery often are made
very soon after the disaster strikes, while  the emergency response is still ongoing.VI.In the U.S., recognition has grown that it is highly desirable to plan for recovery
before an earthquake occurs, and some comm unities (e.g., especially following the
City of Los Angeles) have begun to move  in this direction (Mileti, 1999).However,  at
present, earthquake response planning is much more extensive and more thoroughly
institutionalized than recovery planning .VII.

.

While we increasingly recognize that c oordinated strategies are needed to manage
recovery following major earthquakes and ot her disasters, in order to minimize
long-term negative social and economic impa cts, there is a lack of adequate data
and tools to support recovery decision-making (MCEER, 2000).VIII.Recovery activities are related to mitigation.Effective mitigation can have a significant
effect on a community’s ability to recover swiftly from an earthquake.For example, a
high level of earthquake insurance lessens the financial burden on individuals and
governments to replace damaged property, and frees up resources that can be applied to other aspects of the recovery effort.IX.The recovery from a ma jor earthquake transcends jurisdictional boundaries.A Reconstruction usually needs to be planned and carried out by groups of
jurisdictions at least at the regional  level (i.e., see ac tivities by ABAG at
http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/eqmaps/eqmaps.html).Plans should be made
ahead of time for rebuild ing the infrastructure.Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-17
B.This initially entails developing an appr opriate way for exped iting the review of
applications for rebuildin g immediately after an earthquake.But beyond this,
governments should have some sense, based on a realistic earthquake
scenario, of the likely effect that a major earthquake would have on the
infrastructure.They should know which facilities would survive and which
would not, and plan accordingly.Objective 11.8 Discuss specific r ecovery activities and issues associated with earthquake
disaster recovery planning.Requirements:
The content should be presented as lecture.Remarks:
I.Disaster recovery planning basically involve s asking “What ifs” to prevent later “If
onlys” (CSSC, 2000).II.Studies have found that pre-disaster pla nning can save lives and injuries, limit
property damage, and minimize disruptio ns, enabling communities to recover more
quickly (MCEER, 2000).III.Planning for recovery has a number of components.The following general planning
steps are adapted from the California Seismic Safety Commission Strategic Plan

Planning for “Business Continuation:” Business continuation planning is aimed
at allowing an organization to resume its regular business activities as quickly as
possible after a disaster.In the case of  governments, this means being able to
continue to provide essentia l services to the public with as little disruption as
possible.This is not just a matter of  marshalling physical resources; it also
involves providing the appropriate author ities with human resources to enable
government and business to continue under extreme conditions.B.As with other aspects of emergency pr eparedness, business continuation planning
should be an ongoing program from which an  organization develops and modifies
its continuation plans.And to be fully e ffective, it should involve all members of
the organization.C. Dealing with Building Damage: Repairing and rebuilding damaged buildings is
one element that covers the entire recove ry cycle.Initially, the concern is to
prevent further loss of life or injury, pa rticularly from aftershocks following the
initial seismic activity.Damage to stru ctures must be assessed and buildings
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-18 posted to indicate which buildings are safe  to use.A system of inspecting and
posting key buildings is therefore essentia l if injury and loss of life are to be
minimized.D. Inspections often take the form of two main evaluations: one rapid and one
detailed:
1.A rapid evaluation is carried out to identify and post apparently safe and
obviously unsafe structures, and to de signate buildings whose strength and
safety cannot be determined without  a more thorough examination.These
evaluations usually are done by loca l building inspectors, assisted by
volunteer civil/structural engineers, ar chitects, building contractors, and
other individuals.2.A detailed evaluation is carried out  to evaluate and post buildings of
questionable safety, usually those th at have already been posted as
"Limited Entry."Detailed evaluations are designed to be performed by volunteer engineers within a few hours or days after the rapid evaluation
phase, and are intended to provide re asonable assurance about whether a
building can be returned to or not.3.The effectiveness of any post-earthq uake structural assessment program
depends on effective protocols for the assessment.

 re asonable assurance about whether a
building can be returned to or not.3.The effectiveness of any post-earthq uake structural assessment program
depends on effective protocols for the assessment.

As well, it depends on a
trained and accessible core of volunt eer engineers with the necessary
authority, supplies, and equipm ent to perform their function.E. Removing Debris: A major earthquake is  likely to cause a significant amount
of damage, so debris removal is a ke y element of recovery (as well as of
response).1.Initially, streets must be cleared quickly to allow emergency vehicles
access to help the injured and extinguish fires.2.Subsequently, removing what is le ft of destroyed buildings allows
reconstruction to begin earlier.The personnel and equipment of
governments and private sector companies probably will be needed to remove debris.3.Suitable places to dump earthquake r ubble will have to be identified so
that environmental problems and higher future costs for cleanup can be avoided.Therefore, it is important for governments to identify potential
disposal sites in advance, and to plan  for the logistics of moving debris to
them.Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-19 4.The authority to make decisions abou t the disposition of debris should be
assigned before the event, since such decisions will have to be made quickly once the emergency has occurred.F. Rebuilding: Building regulations need to be es tablished to enable the rebuilding
process to proceed as quickly as possibl e.  In the meantime, temporary housing
must be found for the homeless.Health and safety information must be distributed
among the population to minimize the risk of a disease outbreak resulting, for
example, from drinking contaminated water.G. An effective rebuilding program needs to be supervised by a reconstruction
authority.Such an agency may act for a num ber of governments, and the creation
of one should be contemplated as pa rt of a long-term recovery plan.IV.Economic Recovery:  To find out how best to revi ve the economy, impact studies
have to be carried out to identify how da maged the various elements are, what needs
repair, and how the repairs can be made .Only then can appropriate financial
assistance programs be put into place.Objective 11.9 Discuss importan t keys to effective recovery operations so that economic
and social impact will be minimized.Requirements:
The content should be presented as lecture.Remarks:
I.Recovery once was viewed as a linear phenomenon, with discrete stages and end
products.

 operations so that economic

I.Recovery once was viewed as a linear phenomenon, with discrete stages and end
products.

Today it is seen as a process th at entails decision-making and interaction
among all stakeholders such as households , businesses, and the community at large
(MCEER, 2000).A.Many of the decisions associated with recovery are ones of government
policy.How quickly recovery can or shoul d take place, and how the costs of
recovery will be distributed within the community, largely are determined by
government decisions.Therefore, it is important that governments give
considerable thought to the types of deci sions they will have to make and how
they will carry them out.B.Recovery appears to be most effect ive when community-based organizations
assume principal responsibility, suppl emented by outside technical and
financial assistance (Mileti, 1999).Perhaps a further shift will be needed – away
from an exclusive focus on restoring damaged structures  toward effective
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-20 decision-making  at all levels.Outside technical  assistance can help strengthen
local organizational and decision- making capacity (Mileti, 1999).II.According to MCEER (2003) and MSSC ( 1997), additional general measures key to
effective  earthquake disaster recovery  are:
A.Provide Accurate and Timely Information: Establish a coordinated public
information strategy to provide accurate and timely recovery and mitigation information to public and private se ctors through all available means.B.Identify suitable, earthquake resistant  short- and long-term shelters and
coordinate agreements for their use.1.Earthquake resistant  short- and long-term sh eltering facilities (think
about aftershocks) are required following a major disaster.2.Plan for the construction of l ong-term temporary housing.Develop
contingency plans for the location, de sign and construction of long-term
temporary housing.Long-term temporary housing will be needed for victims displaced by a major earthquake.C. Promote funding and training of  post-earthquake building inspection
volunteers.1.Continue to train volunteers througho ut the jurisdiction to make rapid
visual examinations of buildings.2.By using a system already in plac e for training, certifying, and mobilizing
volunteers, structures that  are safe for occupancy can be rapidly identified
after an earthquake or other disaster .

By using a system already in plac e for training, certifying, and mobilizing
volunteers, structures that  are safe for occupancy can be rapidly identified

This will permit housing and jobs to
be quickly restored.D. Enhance the ability of individuals and small businesses to recover from an
earthquake disaster.1.Enable small businesses to recove r from an earthquake and to access
funding at the federal and state levels in a timely manner so that economic
recovery progresses.2.For instance, develop guidelines to accelerate the permitting and
rebuilding process so that disrupti on of individuals and businesses is
minimized, rapid personal and economi c recovery is assured, and the
adverse economic impact of an earthqua ke will be reduced in the affected
area.Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-21 E. Support identification of facili ties and methods for disposal of
uncontaminated debris and hazardous ma terials from collapsed structures.Prepare a plan for disposal of hazardous materials, contaminated and
uncontaminated debris.Coordination w ill result in improved and efficient,
coordinated disposal of hazardous ma terials and uncontaminated debris.F. Enhance ability to provide crisis counse ling to individuals in affected areas.Develop a network of trained counsel ors who will respond to and provide
counseling to residents in affected ar eas.Residents, particularly children,
probably will have trouble understanding and coping with the emotional trauma
following a major earthquake.Objective 11.10 Describe typical deficiencies  in earthquake recovery activities and
operation.Requirements:
The content should be presented as lecture.Th e homework should be distributed following the
completion of this objective.Handouts Included:    Handout 11.2 -Homework Assignment 11.2
Remarks:
I.Recovery methods have improved with ea ch earthquake; however, there are still a
number of deficiencies that  impair effective and speedy recovery and have resulted
in unacceptable levels of personal and financial loss (Mileti, 1999).II.According to Mileti (1999), deficiencies typically exist in:
A.Funding for effective management of the recovery process (including mitigation).B.Adequate interim shelter and housing, part icularly for those with special needs.C. Plans and resources to accommodate in terim and long-term and post-earthquake
housing..
 D. Adequate knowledge and preparation by the public, business, and service sectors
for effective recovery.III.

 accommodate in terim and long-term and post-earthquake
housing..
 D. Adequate knowledge and preparation by the public, business, and service sectors
for effective recovery.III.

Recovery planning has been given less than adequate attention in the context of
overall earthquake planning (Mileti, 1999).Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-22 A.Failure to plan for recovery can mean that the recovery process may take much
longer than otherwise might be required.B.The lack of recovery planning weakens a community’s ability to plan for
effective mitigation , as the potential costs of economi c and social restoration will
not be known with any accuracy.C. While it is difficult to assign a value to human life, communities and the
public will want to know the cost-benefit implications of different ways to mitigate purely economic risks.D. Prolonged economic instability makes it difficult for the community to regain its
former competitive advantages, and can hold back the rate at which the economy
is rebuilt.IV.Local leaders too often fail to take advantage of the reco very period to reshape their
devastated communities to withstand future events (Mileti, 1999).A.Most local disaster plans need to be extended, not only to explicitly address
recovery and reconstruction, but also to  identify opportunities for rebuilding in
safer ways and in safer places.B.Again,  as noted above, the recovery period following one disaster is often a
time for considering how to mitigate losses!![Instructor note : distribute Handout 11.2 (Homework Assignment) and allow one week for

• Towels  • Work gloves  • Tools/supplies for securing your home   • Extra clothing, hat and sturdy shoes  • Plastic sheeting  • Duct tape  • Scissors  • Household liquid bleach  • Entertainment items   • Blankets or sleeping bags • Sunscreen • Insect Repellent• Meet with your family or household members.• Discuss how to prepare and respond to emergencies that  are most likely to happen where you live, learn, work and play.• Identify responsibilities for each member of your household  and plan to work together as a team.• If a family member is in the military or engages in extended business travel on a regular basis, plan how you would  respond if they were away.• If you or a member of your household is an individual with access or functional needs, including a disability, consider developing a comprehensive evacuation plan in advance with family, care providers and care attendants, as appropriate.Complete a personal assessment of functional abilities and possible needs during and after an emergency or disaster situation, and create a personal support network to assist.Plan what to do in case you are separated during an emergency
• Choose two places to meet—
1.Right outside your home in case of a sudden emergency,
such as a fire.2.Outside your neighborhood, in case you cannot return  home or are asked to evacuate.Consider any transportation challenges that might be encountered by individuals that use mobility assistive equipment.• Choose an out-of-area emergency contact person.It may
be easier to text or call long distance if local phone lines are overloaded or out of service.Everyone should memorize emergency contact information and have it in writing or programmed into their cell phones.

or address can search for messages posted by those who self-register.If you don’t have internet access, call 1-800-RED CROSS
to register yourself and your family.• Identify how local authorities will notify you during a disaster
and how you will get information, whether through local radio,
TV or NOAA Weather Radio stations or channels.• Know the difference between different weather alerts such as
“watches” and “warnings” and what actions to take in each.• Know what actions to take to protect yourself during disasters that may occur in areas where you travel or have moved
recently.For example, if you travel to a place where earthquakes
are common and you are not familiar with them, make sure you
know what to do to protect yourself should one occur.• When a major disaster occurs, your community can change in an instant.Loved ones may be hurt and emergency response is
likely to be delayed.Make sure that at least one member of your
household is trained in first aid and CPR and knows how to use
an automated external defibrillator (AED).This training is useful in many emergency situations.• Share what you have learned with your family, household and
neighbors and encourage them to be informed too.

November 2010 Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101
Version 2.0  Developing and Maintaining
Emergency Operations Plans
 I am pleased to announce the release of Version 2.0 of Comprehensive Prepa redness Guide 101:
Developing and Maintaining Emergency Operations Plans .Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101 provid es guidance for developing emergency operations
plans.It promotes a common understanding of the fundamentals of risk-informed planning and decision making to help planners examine a hazard or threat and produce integrated, coordinated, and synchronized plans.The goal of CPG 101 is to assi st in making the planning process routine across all
phases of emergency management and for all homeland security mission areas.This Guide helps planners at all levels of government in their efforts to develop and maintain viable, all-hazards, all-threats
emergency plans.Based on input from state, territorial, tribal, and local  officials from across the United States, this update
of CPG 101 expands on the fundamentals contained in  the first version.With this edition, greater
emphasis is placed on representing and engaging the whole community—to include those with access and
functional needs, children, and those with household pets and service animals.Residents and all sectors of the community have a critical role and shared responsibility to take
appropriate actions to protect themselves, their families and organizations, and their properties.Planning that engages and includes the whole community serves as the focal point for building a collaborative and resilient community.CPG 101 is the foundation for state, territorial, tribal, and local emergency planning in the United States.Planners in other disciplines, orga nizations, and the private sector, as well as other levels of government,
may find this Guide useful in the development of  their emergency operations plans.While CPG 101
maintains its link to previous guidance, it also re flects the reality of the current operational planning
environment.This Guide integrates key concepts from national preparedness policies and doctrines, as
well as lessons learned from disasters, major incidents, national assessments, and grant programs.W .C r a i g  F u g a t e

Preface
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101 prov ides Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) guidance on the fundamentals of planning a nd developing emergency operations plans (EOP).CPG 101 shows that EOPs are connected to planning efforts in the areas of prevention, protection,
response, recovery, and mitigation.Version 2.0 of this Guide expands on these fundamentals and
encourages emergency and homeland security managers  to engage the whole community in addressing all
risks that might impact their jurisdictions.While CPG 101 maintains its link to previous guidance, it also reflects the reality of the current
operational planning enviro nment.This Guide integrates key concepts from national preparedness
policies and doctrines, as well as lessons learned fro m disasters, major incidents, national assessments,
and grant programs.CPG 101 provides methods for planners to:
• Conduct community-based planning that engages th e whole community by using a planning process
that represents the actual population in the comm unity and involves community leaders and the
private sector in the planning process
• Ensure plans are developed through an analysis of risk
• Identify operational assumptions and resource demands
• Prioritize plans and planning efforts to support their seamless transition from development to
execution for any threat or hazard
• Integrate and synchronize efforts across all levels of government.CPG 101 incorporates the following concepts from operational planning research and day-to-day experience:
• The process of planning is just as important as the resulting document.• Plans are not scripts followed to the letter, but ar e flexible and adaptable to the actual situation.• Effective plans convey the goals and objectives of the intended operation and the actions needed to
achieve them.Successful operations occur when organizations know thei r roles, understand how they fit into the overall
plan, and are able to execute the plan.This Guide is part of a series of CPGs publishe d by FEMA.CPG 101 discusses the steps used to produce
an EOP, possible plan structures, and components of a basic plan and its annexes.CPGs provide detailed
information about planning considerations fo r specific functions, hazards, and threats.CPG 101 is the foundation for state, territorial, tribal, and local emergency planning in the United States.

Introduction and Overview
Purpose
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide (CPG) 101 provid es guidelines on developi ng emergency operations
plans (EOP).

It promotes a common understanding of the fundamentals of risk-informed planning and
decision making to help planners examine a hazard or threat and produce integrated, coordinated, and synchronized plans.The goal of CPG 101 is to make the planning process routine across all phases of emergency management and for all homeland security mission areas.This Guide helps planners at all
levels of government in their efforts to develop and maintain viable all-hazards, all-threats EOPs.Accomplished properly, planning provides a methodical way to engage the whole community in thinking
through the life cycle of a potential crisis, determ ining required capabilities, and establishing a framework
for roles and responsibilities.It shapes how a community envisions and shares a desired outcome, selects
effective ways to achieve it, and communicates expect ed results.Each jurisdic tion’s plans must reflect
what that community will do to address its specific ri sks with the unique resources it has or can obtain.Planners achieve unity of purpose through coordination and integration of plans across all levels of government, nongovernmental
organizations, the private sector, and individuals
and families.This supports the fundamental principle that, in many situations, emergency manage ment and homeland security operations start at the
local level and expand to include Federal, state, terri torial, tribal, regional, and private sector assets as the
affected jurisdiction requires additional resources and capabilities.Plans must, therefore, integrate vertically to ensure a common operati onal focus.Similarly, horizontal in tegration ensures that individual
department and agency EOPs fit into the jurisdic tion’s plans, and that each department or agency
understands, accepts, and is prepared to execute identified mission assignments.Incorporating vertical and horizontal integration into a shared planning co mmunity ensures that the sequence and scope of an
operation are synchronized.“Let our advance worrying become advanced thinking
and planning.”
Winston Churchill
A shared planning community increases the likelihoo d of integration and synchronization, makes
planning cycles more efficient and effective, and makes plan maintenance easier.Applicability and Scope
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEM A) recommends that teams responsible for
developing EOPs use CPG 101 to guide their efforts.It provides a context for emergency planning in
light of other existing plans and describes a universal planning process.

 for
developing EOPs use CPG 101 to guide their efforts.It provides a context for emergency planning in
light of other existing plans and describes a universal planning process.

This Guide recognizes that many
jurisdictions across the country have already deve loped EOPs that address many emergency management
operations.Therefore, CPG 101 establishes no immediate requirements, but suggests that the next
iteration of all EOPs follow this guidance.Additionally, regulatory requirements may necessitate the use of additiona l guides for the development of
certain EOP annexes (e.g., the requirements for th e Radiological Emergency Preparedness Program).CPG 101 has been designed to complement the use of those guides where required by law or regulation.Intro-1

Supersession
CPG 101 replaces State and Local Guide 101, which is  rescinded.In addition, CPG 101 Version 2.0
supersedes CPG 101 Version 1.0, which is rescinded.CPG 101 Version 2.0 also supersedes the Interim
CPG 301, which is rescinded.How to Use This Guide
CPG 101 is designed to help both novi ce and experienced planners navigate  the planning process.Used in
its entirety, this Guide provides information and in struction on the fundamentals of planning and their
application.Chapters 1 and 2 lay the foundation for planning efforts by providing information on the
basics of planning (Chapter 1) and the environment wi thin which planners function (Chapter 2).With an
understanding of these fundamentals, the Guide then tr ansitions from theory to practice by discussing the
different plan formats and functions (Chapter 3) a nd moving into an explanation of the planning process
(Chapter 4).A detailed checklist, building upon Chapte rs 3 and 4, is provided in Appendix C. Because
Appendix C provides a set of detailed questions to consider throughout the planning process, users are
encouraged to copy or remove this checklist and em ploy it as they work through the planning process in
Chapter 4.Suggested Training
To use this Guide to its fullest, users will benef it from training in emergency management and emergency
planning.Appendix D provides a suggested list of training courses to increase users’ understanding of
emergency management and em ergency planning concepts.

National Incident Management System
Implementation
In November 2005, FEMA’s National Integration Center published guides for integrating National
Incident Management System (NIMS) concepts into EOPs.1 CPG 101 incorporates the concepts and
suggestions found in those documents , which have been discontinued.Administrative Information
Terms and acronyms in the text come from the FEMA Acronyms, Abbreviations, and Terms; the National
Response Framework (NRF); the NIMS; or the Homela nd Security Act of 2002.Websites referenced in
this Guide were active at the time of its publication.CPG 101 uses the following contextual definitions fo r incident, state, and local government throughout
the document:
• Incident  means an occurrence or event—natural, te chnological, or human-caused—that requires a
response to protect life, property, or the environm ent (e.g., major disasters, emergencies, terrorist
attacks, terrorist threats, civil unrest, wild land and urban fires, floods, hazardous materials
[HAZMAT] spills, nuclear accidents, aircraft accidents, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, tropical

storms, tsunamis, war-related disasters, public health and medical emergencies, other occurrences
requiring an emergency response).• State  means any state of the United States, and includes the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth
of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, Amer ican Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern
Mariana Islands, a Native American Tribe or organization,2 an Alaska native village or Regional
Native Corporation, and any possession of the United States.

• Local government  means:
– A county, municipality, city, town, township, local public authority, school district, special district, intrastate district, council of governments (regardless of whether the council of governments is incorporated as a not-for-profit corpor ation under state law), regional or interstate
government entity, or agency or instrumentality of a local government
– A rural community, unincorporated town or village, or other public entity.Revision Process
FEMA will revise CPG 101, as needed, and issue cha nge pages through the publication distribution
system and online through approved sources.FEMA welcomes recommendations on how to improve th is Guide so it better serves the needs of the
emergency management community.Provide r ecommendations for improving this Guide to:

Overview
The elected and appointed leaders in each jurisdic tion are responsible for ensuring that necessary and
appropriate actions are taken to protect people and pr operty from any threat or hazard.When threatened
by any hazard, citizens expect elected or appointed le aders to take immediate action to help them resolve
the problem.Citizens expect the government to marsha l its resources, channel the efforts of the whole
community—including voluntary organizations and the private sector—and, if necessary, solicit
assistance from outside the jurisdiction.Residents and all sectors of the community have a critical role and shared responsibility to take
appropriate actions to protect themselves, their families and organizations, and their properties.Planning that includes the whole community builds a resilient community.3
 This chapter serves as a foundation for the rest of th e Guide by providing an overview of the basics of
planning.It describes how risk-informed, community -based planning supports decision making.This
chapter also discusses key planning concepts , effective planning, and planning pitfalls.

 key planning concepts , effective planning, and planning pitfalls.

Planning Fundamentals
Planning Principles
Ap
 pplying the following principles to the planning proc ess is key to developing an all-hazards plan for
rotecting lives, property, and the environment:
Planning must be community-based,
representing the whole population and its needs.Understanding the composition of the
population—such as accounting for people with
disabilities, others with access and functional needs, and for the needs of children—must occur
from the outset of the planning effort.For example, the demographics of the population, includi ng its resources and needs, have a profound effect on
evacuation, shelter operations , and family reunification.4 Another key consideration is the integration of
household pets and service animals into the planning  process.Many individuals may make decisions on
whether to comply with protective action measure s based on the jurisdiction’s ability to address the
concerns about their household pets  and service animals.Establishing a profile of the community will also
let planners know if courses of action are feasible.For example, if the majority of the actual resident population do not own cars, then planning efforts must account for greater transportation resource requirements than if the population was predom inately composed of car-owning households.The
businesses that comprise your jurisdiction must also be a part of your demographics—your jurisdiction Community-based planning  is the concept that
planning must not only be re presentative of the actual
population within the community, but also must involve
the whole community in the planning process.The
process for engaging the whole community in
communit y-based planning  is discussed in Cha pter 4.3 Per the Department of Homeland Security Risk Lexicon (http://www .dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/dhs_risk_lexicon.pdf), resiliency is the
ability for governments, infrastructures, systems, businesses, and citizenry to resist, absorb, recover from, or adapt to an ad verse
occurrence that may cause harm or destructi on to our health, safety, economic well-being,  essential services, or public confide nce.

4 Planners should ensure compliance with the r equirements of Title VI of the Civil Ri ghts Act of 1964, Executive Order 13166, th e
Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of the Rehabilitati on Act, and other Federal, state, or local laws and anti-discri mination
laws.1-1
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
may house the only business providing a critical re source to your area or the Nation.By fully
understanding the composition and requirements of the actual population (including all segments of the
community), community-based plans will lead to improved response and recovery activities and,
ultimately, overall preparedness.Planning must include participation from all stakeholders in the community.Effective planning
ensures that the whole community is represented and involved in the planning process.The most realistic
and complete plans are prepared by a diverse planning team, including representatives from the jurisdiction’s departments and agencies, civic leader s, businesses, and organizations (e.g., civic, social,
faith-based, humanitarian, educational, advocacy, pr ofessional) who are able to contribute critical
perspectives and/or have a role in executing the plan.The demographics of the community will aid in determining who to involve as the planning team is constructed.Including community leaders
representative of the entire community in planning reinforces the expectation that the community
members have a shared responsibility and strengthens the public motivation to conduct planning for
themselves, their families, and their organizations.For example, it is essential to incorporate individuals
with disabilities or specific access and functional needs a nd individuals with limited English proficiency,
as well as the groups and organizati ons that support these individuals, in all aspects of the planning
process.When the plan considers and incorporates the views of the individuals and organizations
assigned tasks within it, they are more  likely to accept and use the plan.Planning uses a logical and analytical problem-so lving process to help address the complexity and
uncertainty inherent in potential hazards and threats.By following a set of logical steps that includes
gathering and analyzing information, determining ope rational objectives, and developing alternative ways
to achieve the objectives, planning allows a jurisdic tion or regional response structure to work through
complex situations.Planning helps a jurisdiction iden tify the resources at its disposal to perform critical
tasks and achieve desired outcomes/target levels of  performance.

 allows a jurisdic tion or regional response structure to work through
complex situations.Planning helps a jurisdiction iden tify the resources at its disposal to perform critical
tasks and achieve desired outcomes/target levels of  performance.

Rather than concentrating on every
detail of how to achieve the objective, an effectiv e plan structures thinking and supports insight,
creativity, and initiative in the face of an uncertain  and fluid environment.While using a prescribed
planning process cannot guarantee success, inadequa te plans and insufficient planning are proven
contributors to failure.Planning considers all hazards and threats.While the causes of emergencies can vary greatly, many of
the effects do not.Planners can address common opera tional functions in their basic plans instead of
having unique plans for every type of hazard or threat .For example, floods, wildfires, HAZMAT releases,
and radiological dispersal devices ma y lead a jurisdiction to issue an evacuation order and open shelters.Even though each hazard’s characteristics (e.g., speed of onset, size of the affected area) are different, the
general tasks for conducting an evacua tion and shelter operations are the same.Planning for all threats and
hazards ensures that, when addressing emergency f unctions, planners identify common tasks and those
responsible for accomp lishing the tasks.Planning should be flexible enough to add ress both traditional and catastrophic incidents.Scalable
planning solutions are the most likely to be understood and executed properly by the operational
personnel who have practice in applying them.Planners can test whether critical plan elements are sufficiently flexible by exercising them against scenarios of varying ty pe and magnitude.In some cases,
planners may determine that exceptional policies and approaches are necessary for responding to and recovering from catastrophic incidents.These excepti onal planning solutions should be documented
within plans, along with clear descriptions of the triggers that indicate they are necessary.Plans must clearly identify the mission and supporting goals (with desired results).More than any
other plan element, the clear definition of the mission and supporting goals (which specify desired
results/end-states) enables unity of effort and c onsistency of purpose am ong the multiple groups and

activities involved in executing the plan.Every othe r plan element should be designed and evaluated
according to its contributions to accomplishing the mission and achieving the goals and desired results.Planning depicts the anticipated environment for action.This anticipation promotes early
understanding and agreement on planning assumptions and risks, as well as the context for interaction.

 desired results.Planning depicts the anticipated environment for action.This anticipation promotes early
understanding and agreement on planning assumptions and risks, as well as the context for interaction.

In
situations where a specific hazard has not been  experienced, planning provides the opportunity to
anticipate conditions and systematically identify po tential problems and workable solutions.Planners
should review existing EOPs to ensure current assumptions are still necessary and valid.After-action
reports (AAR) of recent emergency operations and exer cises in the jurisdiction will help planners develop
a list of lessons learned to address when updating plans.Planning does not need to start from scratch .Planners should take advantage of the experience of other planners, as well as plans generated by
other jurisdictions.Further, many states publish
their own standards and guidance for emergency planning, conduct workshops and training courses, and assign their planners to work with local planners.FEMA offers resident, locally presented,
and independent study emergency planning courses.FEMA also publishes guidance related to planning
for specific functions and risks.By participating in this training and reviewing existing emergency or
contingency plans, planners can: Key infrastructure sectors, often owned and operated
by the private sector, are frequently well prepared to maintain their business continuity and protect their employees.Their planning often follows recognized
industry standards or established regulatory
requirements.Use key infrastructure planning to complement State and local planning.• Identify applicable authorities and statutes
• Gain insight into community risk perceptions
• Identify organizational arrangements used in the past
• Identify mutual aid agreements (MAA) with other jurisdictions
• Identify private sector planning that can comp lement and focus public sector planning
• Learn how historical planning issues were resolved
• Identify preparedness gaps.Planning identifies tasks, allocates resources to accomplish those tasks, and establishes
accountability.Decision makers must ensure that they provide planners with clearly established priorities
and adequate resources; additionally, planners and plan participants should be held accountable for
effective planning and execution.Planning includes  senior officials throughout the pro cess to ensure both understanding and
approval.Potential planning team members have many da y-to-day concerns but must be reminded that
emergency planning is a high priority.Senior o fficial buy-in helps the planning process meet
requirements of time, planning horizons, simplicity, and level of detail.The more involved decision
makers are in planning, the bette r the planning product will be.

.The more involved decision
makers are in planning, the bette r the planning product will be.

The emergency or homeland security planner, hereafter referred to simply as “planner,” must reaffirm the
senior official’s understanding that planning is an ite rative, dynamic process that ultimately facilitates his
or her job in a crisis situation by:
• Identifying and sharing the hazard, risk, and threat analyses for the jurisdiction
• Discussing readiness and cap ability assessments, as well as exercise critiques
  1-3
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
• Describing what the government body and the senior offi cial will have to do prior to, during, and after
an incident to either prevent or minimize the incident’s impact.Senior officials play a critical role in determining when and which plans should be developed or revised.Additionally, they customarily have the authority to  approve the final product in coordination with key
stakeholders.By participating th roughout the planning process, senio r officials will better understand how
to implement the plan during an incident.Time, uncertainty, risk, and experience influence planning .These factors define the starting point
where planners apply appropriate concepts and methods to create solutions to particular problems.Planning is, therefore, often considered to be both an art and a science in that successful planners are able
to draw from both operational experience and an unders tanding of emergency management principles, but
also are intuitive, creative, and have the ability to  anticipate the unexpected.While the science and
fundamental principles of planning can be learned th rough training and experience, the art of planning
requires an understanding of the dynamic relations hips among stakeholders, of special political
considerations, and of the complexity imposed by the situation.Because this activity involves judgment and the balancing of competing demands, plans s hould not be overly detailed—to be followed by the
letter—or so general that they provide insufficient direction.Mastering the balance of art and science is the most challenging aspect of becoming a successful planner.Effective plans tell those with operational responsib ilities what to do and why to do it, and they
instruct those outside the jurisdiction in how to provide support and what to expect.Plans must
clearly communicate to operational personnel and support providers what their roles and responsibilities are and how those complement the activities of others .There should be no ambiguity regarding who is
responsible for major tasks.

 are and how those complement the activities of others .There should be no ambiguity regarding who is
responsible for major tasks.

This enables personnel to operate as a productive team more effectively,
reducing duplication of effort and enha ncing the benefits of collaboration.Planning is fundamentally a process to manage risk .Risk
management is a process by which context is defined, risks are identified and assessed, and courses of action for managing those risks are analyzed, decided upon, and implemented,
monitored, and evaluated.As part of the process, planning is a
tool that allows for systematic risk management to reduce or eliminate risks in the future.Planning is one of the key components of the preparedness
cycle.The preparedness cycle ( Figure 1.1 ) illustrates the way
that plans are continuously evaluated and improved through a
cycle of planning, organizing, training, equipping, exercising, evaluating, and taking corrective action.Strategic, Operational, and Tactical Planning
There are three tiers of planning: strategic planning, operational planning, and tactical (incident scene) planning.Stra tegic planning sets the context and expectations for
operational planning, while operationa l planning provides the framework for tactical planning.All three
tiers of planning occur at all levels of government.Figure 1.1: The Preparedness Cycle
 Strategic plans  describe how a jurisdiction wants to meet its emergency management or homeland
security responsibilities over the long-term.These plans are driven by policy from senior officials and
establish planning priorities.1-4
1.The Basics of Planning
Operational plans  provide a description of roles and responsibilities, tasks, integration, and actions
required of a jurisdiction or its departments and agen cies during emergencies.Jurisdictions use plans to
provide the goals, roles, and responsibilities that a jurisdiction’s departments and agencies are assigned,
and to focus on coordinating and integrating the activ ities of the many response and support organizations
within a jurisdiction.They also consider private sector  planning efforts as an integral part of community-
based planning, and to ensure efficient allocation of resources.Department and agency plans do the same
thing for the internal elements of those organizations .Operational plans tend to focus more on the broader
physical, spatial, and time-related dimensions of an operation; thus, they tend to be more complex and
comprehensive, yet less defined, than tactical plans.Tactical plans  focus on managing personnel, equipment, and resources that play a direct role in an
incident response.

 more complex and
comprehensive, yet less defined, than tactical plans.Tactical plans  focus on managing personnel, equipment, and resources that play a direct role in an
incident response.

Pre-incident tactical planning , based upon existing operational plans, provides the
opportunity to pre-identify personnel, equipment, ex ercise, and training requirements.These gaps can
then be filled through various means (e.g., mutu al aid, technical assistance, updates to policy,

Comprehensive and integrated planning can help othe r levels of government plan their response to an
incident within a jurisdiction.By knowing the exte nt of the jurisdiction’s capability, supporting planners
can pre-identify shortfalls and deve lop pre-scripted resource requests.Planning Approaches
Planners use a number of approaches, either singly or in combination, to develop plans:
• Scenario-based planning.This approach starts with building a scenario for a hazard or threat.Then,
planners analyze the impact of the scenario to determine appropriate courses of action.Planners
  1-5
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
typically use this planning concept to develop pl anning assumptions, primarily for hazard- or threat-
specific annexes to a basic plan.• Function-based planning (functional planning).This approach identifies the common functions that
a jurisdiction must perform during emergencies.F unction-based planning defines the function to be
performed and some combination of government  agencies and departments responsible for its
performance as a course of action.• Capabilities-based planning .This approach focuses on a jurisdicti on’s capacity to take a course of
action.Capabilities-based planning answers the question, “Do I have the right mix of training,
organizations, plans, people, leadership and management, equipment, and facilities to perform a required emergency function?” Some planners view this approach as a combination of scenario- and
function-based planning because of its “scenario-to-task-to-capability” focus.In reality, planners commonly use a combination of the three previous approaches to operational
planning.This hybrid planning approach provides the basis for the planning process discussed in
Chapter 4.Using the hybrid approach converts re quirements generated by a scenario into goals and
objectives that drive the planning process.

.Using the hybrid approach converts re quirements generated by a scenario into goals and
objectives that drive the planning process.

It leads to a basic plan that describes overarching roles,
relationships, and responsibilities with functional, hazard, and threat a nnexes that reflect sequencing of
actions.A hybrid planning approach helps identify the courses of action that a jurisdiction must be able to
take and the required functions it must perform based upon a comprehensive risk analysis; thus, it helps
identify the capabilities a jurisdiction must have.FEMA strongly advocates the hybrid approach.Plan Integration
National guidance and consensus standards expect th at a jurisdiction’s plans will be coordinated and
integrated among all levels of governme nt and with critical infrastructure planning efforts.The NIMS and
NRF support a concept of layered operations.They recognize that all incidents start at the local level, and,
as needs exceed resources and capabilities, Federal, state,  territorial, tribal, regional, and private sector
assets are applied.This approach mean s that planning must be vertically integrated to ensure that all
response levels have a common operational focus.Sim ilarly, planners at each level must ensure that
department and supporting agency plans fit into th eir jurisdiction’s concept of operations (CONOPS)
through horizontal integration.Planners must  also appropriately integrate the community’s
nongovernmental and private sector plans and resources.Vertical integration  is the meshing of planning both up and dow n the various levels of government.It
follows the concept that the foundation for operations is at the local level and that support from Federal,
state, territorial, tribal, regional, and private sector  entities is layered onto the local activities.This means
that as a planning team identifies a support requirement from a “higher level” during the planning
process, the two levels work together to resolve the situation.Chapter 2 presents a concept for vertical integration.Horizontal integration serves two purposes.First, it integrates operations across a jurisdiction.For
example, an agency, department, or sector would writ e its plan or standard ope rating procedures/standard
operating guidelines (SOPs/SOGs) for its role in an evacuation to fit the controlling jurisdiction’s plan for
such an evacuation.Horizontal integration allows departments and support agencies to produce plans that meet their internal needs or regulatory requirements and still integrate into the EOP.Second, horizontal
integration ensures that a jurisdiction’s set of plan s supports its neighboring or partner jurisdictions’
similar sets of plans.

 to produce plans that meet their internal needs or regulatory requirements and still integrate into the EOP.Second, horizontal
integration ensures that a jurisdiction’s set of plan s supports its neighboring or partner jurisdictions’
similar sets of plans.

A jurisdiction’s plan should include information about mission assignments that it executes in conjunction with, in support of, or with support from its neighbors or partners.1-6
1.The Basics of Planning
Plan Synchronization
The concept of sequencing creates effective EOPs that  are synchronized in time, space, and purpose.Four
planning concepts help sequence operations: phasing, branches, planning horizons, and forward and
reverse planning.Phasing .A phase is a specific part of an operation that is  distinctly different from the ones that precede or
follow.For example, a set of phases might incl ude routine operations, heightened awareness,
mobilization-activation-deployment, incident response, and transition to recovery.Planners often use the
factors of time, distance, geography, resources, and critical events to define phase lengths.Branches.A branch is an option built into an EOP.For ex ample, a hurricane may affect a certain state by
moving up its coast, by moving inland and traveling up a large bay, or by taking a more middle track that
affects both areas.While many elements of the plan would be the same for all three scenarios, the change
in track could affect response activities.Under the c oncept of branching, the hurricane annex of an EOP
would provide options for each major contingency, th erefore allowing the planner to anticipate different
requirements and courses of action.Planners use br anches only for major, critical options and not for
every possible variation in the response.Planning horizon.A planning horizon is a point in time that planners use to focus the planning effort.Because no one can predict when most incidents will occur, planners typically use planning horizons
expressed in months to years when developing EOPs .For example, the base components of an EOP may
be updated on a two- to three-year cycle, while ke y annexes may be on a shorter cycle.Since planners
develop these plans with little or no specific knowledge of how a future incident will evolve, the plan must describe broad concepts that allow for quick a nd flexible operations.They must allow for several
courses of action and project potential uses of or ganizations and resources during those operations.Planners should view plans as living contingency plans because they provide the starting point for
response operations if and when an emergency occurs.Forward and reverse planning.

 and project potential uses of or ganizations and resources during those operations.Planners should view plans as living contingency plans because they provide the starting point for
response operations if and when an emergency occurs.Forward and reverse planning.

Forward planning starts with (assum ed) present conditions and lays out
potential decisions and actions forward in time, buildi ng an operation step-by-step toward the desired goal
or objective.Conversely, reverse planning starts w ith the end in mind and works backward, identifying
the objectives necessary and the related actions to ach ieve the desired end-state.When using reverse
planning, it is essential to have a well-defined goal or  objective.In practice, planners usually use a
combination of the two methods: they use forward planning  to look at what is feasible in the time allotted
and use reverse planning to establish the desire d goal (or end-state) and related objectives.Common Planning Pitfalls
The most common planning pitfall is the developmen t of lengthy, overly detailed plans that those
responsible for their execution do not read.A plan that tries to cover every conceivable condition or that
attempts to address every detail will only frustrate, constrain, and confuse those charged with its
implementation.Successful plans are simple and flexible.Another major pitfall faced by planners is faili ng to account for the community’s needs, concerns,
capabilities, and desire to help.Often, plans are writte n based on the “average citizen” or mirror image of
the planners.However, communities are diverse and co mprise a wide variety of people, including those
with access and functional needs, those requiring the support of service animals, and those who cannot independently care for themselves, such as children.This also includes diverse racial and ethnic populations and immigrant communitie s. Failing to base planning on th e demographics and requirements
of the particular community may lead to false planning assumptions, ineffective courses of action, and
inaccurate resource calculations.Related to this pitfall is the notion that responders are the only people
  1-7
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
who can take action.The public often does their work  before responders arrive.The community must be
engaged in the planning pr ocess and included as an integral part of the plan.Planning is only as good as the information on which it is based.Too often, planners rely on untested
assumptions or uncoordinated resources.

.Too often, planners rely on untested
assumptions or uncoordinated resources.

Planners shoul d ensure that they have adequately validated
assumptions and properly coordinate d with those agencies/entities that  they include in their plan.Planning needs may be coordinated directly with a required agency/entity via a memorandum of
agreement (MOA)/memorandum of understanding (MOU) or by signatory of a designated representative.Planning is not a theoretical process that occurs w ithout an understanding of the community, nor is it a
scripting process that tries to prescribe hazard actions and response actions with unjustified precision.Community-based plans provide a starting point for op erations, adjusting as the situation dictates and as
facts replace planning assumptions.Planning Considerations
Emergency planning includes the key areas involved in addressing any threat or hazard: prevention, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation.Integrating the key areas as part of the overall planning effort allows jurisdictions to produce an effective EOP and advance overall preparedness.Prevention  consists of actions that reduce risk from hum an-caused incidents, primarily terrorism (see
Figure 1.3 ).Prevention planning can also help mitigate secondary or opportunistic incidents that may
occur after the primary incident.Incorporating prevention methods into the comprehensive planning process also helps a jurisdiction identify information or intelligence requirements that support the overall
planning process.Figure 1.3: Types of Hazards
Protection reduces or eliminates a threat to people, propert y, and the environment.Primarily focused on
adversarial incidents, the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources (CIKR) is vital to local jurisdictions, national security, pub lic health and safety, and econo mic vitality.Protection planning
safeguards citizens and their freedoms, critical infr astructure, property, and the economy from acts of
terrorism, natural disasters, or other emergencies.It includes actions or measures taken to cover or shield

assets from exposure, injury, or destruction.Protective actions may occur before, during, or after an incident and prevent, minimize, or
contain the impact of an incident.Response embodies the actions taken in the immediate aftermath of an incident to save and sustain lives, meet basic human needs, and reduce the loss of property and the effect on
critical infrastructure and the environment.Following an incident, response operations reduce the physical, psychological, social, and economic effects of an incident.

 meet basic human needs, and reduce the loss of property and the effect on
critical infrastructure and the environment.Following an incident, response operations reduce the physical, psychological, social, and economic effects of an incident.

Response planning provides rapid and disciplined incident
assessment to ensure a quickly scalable,
adaptable, and flexible response.It incorporates national response doctrine as presented in the NRF, which defines basic roles and responsibilities for incident response across all
levels of government and the private sector.Recovery encompasses both short-term and long-term efforts for the rebuilding and revitalization of affected communities.Recovery planning builds stakeholder
partnerships that lead to community restoration
and future sustainability and resiliency.5
Recovery planning must provide for a near-seamle ss transition from response activities to short-term
recovery operations—including restoration of interrupted utility services, reestablishment of
transportation routes, and the provision of food and shelter to displaced persons.Planners should design
long-term recovery plans to maximize results thr ough the efficient use of resources and incorporate
national recovery doctrine.A recovery plan should address: Planning for Adaptive versus Non-Adaptive Risks
One of the fundamental challenges planners face is how
to address, through their planning efforts, the differences
in risk that a hazard or threat poses to a jurisdiction.One way to focus those efforts is to determine whether the hazard’s or threat’s risk is adaptive or non-adaptive.A
hazard or threat shows adaptive risk if it has the ability to change its behavior or characteristics in reaction to protection, prevention, response, or recovery measures taken by a jurisdiction.Only human-caused hazards or
adversarial threats, such as civil disturbances or
terrorism, have adaptive risk characteristics.When facing a hazard or threat characterized by adaptive risk, planners must continually evaluate and evolve their plans
as the adversary learns and adapts to existing plans.Natural and technological hazards fall into the category of non-adaptive risks.Their physical characteristics and
disaster dimensions do not change when a jurisdiction
takes preventive, protective, or mitigation measures.Plans for such hazards tend to be more stable, requiring change only as the characteristics of the jurisdiction
change.Traditional mitigation activities are most
appropriate to deal with these risks.It is important to remember that this is not a “black and white” differentiation—extremist groups may take the opportunity
presented by a hurricane (non-adaptive risk) to launch a
terrorist attack (adaptive risk).

• Recovery-related MAAs and regional compacts
• Prewritten emergency ordinances that facilitate rec overy operations, such as those dealing with road
closures, debris removal,  and expedited permitting
• Continuity of government (COG) operations (may also be addressed in a separate continuity of
operations [COOP] plan)
• Strategies for including civic leaders and the public in the recovery decision-making process
• Community efforts that affect mitigation processes with  the potential to reduce the effects of a threat
or incident.Mitigation , with its focus on the impact of a hazard, encompasses the structural and non-structural
approaches taken to eliminate or limit a hazard’s presen ce; peoples’ exposure; or interactions with people,
property, and the environment.The emphasis on sustai ned actions to reduce long-term risk differentiates

activities include:
• Complying with or exceeding National Flood Insura nce Program floodplain management regulations
• Enforcing stringent building codes, flood-proofing requirements, seismic design standards, and wind-
bracing requirements for new constructi on or repairing existing buildings
• Adopting zoning ordinances that steer development aw ay from areas subject to flooding, storm surge,
or coastal erosion
• Retrofitting public buildings to withstand ground shaking or hurricane-strength winds
• Acquiring damaged homes or businesses in flood-prone areas, relocating the structures, and returning
the property to open space, wetlands, or recreational uses
• Building community shelters and tornado safe rooms to help protect people in their homes, public
buildings, and schools in hurricane- and tornado-prone areas.2.Understanding the

ning Environment: Federal, State, and Local Plans
Overview
Understanding the basics of planning is critical to the planner’s role.

Building on that understanding, this
chapter explains the environment within which this planning occurs, outlines the links between different
levels of government, and summarizes how planning  considerations shape the content of the NRF,
Federal plans, and state/local EOPs.Relationship Between Federal Plans and State Emergency Operations Plans
Federal plans and state EOPs describe each respective government-level approach to emergency operations.Because these levels of government all pr ovide support to emergency operations conducted at
the local level, there are similar and overlapping functions in their plans.As indicated in Chapter 1, all levels of government mu st coordinate plans vertically to ensure a singular
operational focus.The goal is to ensure the eff ectiveness of combined Federal and state operations
through integration and synchroniza tion.Key concepts for a national planning structure—integration and
synchronization—serve different but equally important purposes in linking Federal plans and state EOPs.From the Federal perspective, integrated planning helps answer the question of how Federal agencies and
departments add the right resources at the right time to support state and local operations.From the states’
perspectives, integrated planning provides answers to  questions about which other organizations to work
with and where to obtain resources.The National Incident Management System
NIMS provides a consistent framework for incident management, regardless of the cause, size, or
complexity of the incident.NIMS provides the Nati on’s first responders and authorities with the same
foundation for incident management for all hazards.The Incident Command System (ICS) is a critical
component of NIMS and is used to manage all domestic incidents.2-1
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
As part of the development of EOPs, instituti onalizing NIMS means that government officials:
• Adopt NIMS through executive order, proclamation,  or legislation as the jurisdiction’s official
incident response system
• Direct all incident managers and response organizations in their jurisdictions to train, exercise, and
use NIMS in their response operations
• Integrate NIMS into functional, system-wide emer gency operations policies, plans, and procedures
• Provide ICS training for responders, su pervisors, and command-level officers
• Conduct exercises for responders at all levels , including responders from all disciplines and
jurisdictions.

, su pervisors, and command-level officers
• Conduct exercises for responders at all levels , including responders from all disciplines and
jurisdictions.

Depending on the jurisdiction, institutionalization means that an EOP should:
• Use ICS and the multiagency coordination system to  manage and support all incidents, including
recurring and/or planned special events
• Integrate all response agencies and entities into a single, seamless system, from the incident command
post, to the department emergency operations centers  (EOC) and local EOCs, to the state EOC, and to
regional- and national-level entities
• Develop and implement a public information plan
• Identify and characterize all resources according to established standards and types
• Ensure that all personnel are trained properly for th e jobs they perform and the training is validated
• Ensure interoperability, accessibility, and redundancy of communications.Planners should consider each of these requirements as they develop or revise their jurisdiction’s EOP.The National Response Framework
The NRF is a guide to how the Na tion conducts all-hazards incident response.The NRF states that each
Federal department or agency must also plan for its role in incident respon se.Virtually every Federal
department and agency possesses resources that a jurisdiction may need when responding to an incident.Some Federal departments and agen cies have primary responsibility for specific aspects of incident
response, such as HAZMAT remediation.Others may have supporting roles in providing different types
of resources, such as communications personnel and e quipment.Regardless of their roles, all Federal
departments and agencies must develop policies, plans, and procedures governing how they will
effectively locate resources and provide them as part of a coordinated Federal response.The planning
considerations described for response can al so guide prevention and protection planning.Planning Considerations
The NRF identifies government responsibility to devel op detailed all-hazards/all-threats EOPs.It states
these plans should:
• Define leadership roles and respons ibilities and clearly articulate the decisions that need to be made,
who will make them, and when
• Include an all-hazards basic plan, as well as hazard- and threat-specific annexes
• Integrate and incorporate key private sector and nongovernmental elements

Understanding the Planning Environment: Federal, State, and Local Plans
• Include strategies for both no-notice and forewarned evacuations, with particular consideration given
to assisting children, as well as individuals with disabilities, access and functional needs, or limited
English proficiency.State, Territorial, and Tribal Government Planning
State, territorial, and tribal governments have significant resources of their own, including emergency
management and homeland security agencies, police departments, health agencies, transportation agencies, incident management teams, specialized teams, and the National Guard.The NRF states that the role of a state government during emergency response is to supplement local efforts before, during, and
after a disaster or emergency situation.If a state anticipates that its needs may exceed its resources, the
Governor can request assistance from other states through MAAs (e.g., Emergency Management Assistance Compact) and/or from the Federal Government.Local Government Planning
Resilient Communities and Planning
Resilience, broadly defined, is the ability to
resist, absorb, recover from, or adapt to an
adverse occurrence.Engaging the community
in the planning process will improve community resiliency by increasing the understanding of threats and hazards,
participating in the planning process, and
communicating the expected actions for the community to undertake during an emergency.At the local and state level, this entails
knowing the community and its demographics, as well as involving both the
formal and informal co mmunity leadership
structure in the planning process.This is true
for all levels of government as each level works to engage the issues surrounding
individuals with access and functional needs,
individuals with limited English proficiency, children, and those with household pets and service animals.Engaging the private sector is a critical
element of the process.Much of the critical
infrastructure necessary to our communities is
owned and operated by the private sector.Connecting the government and the private
sector is, therefore, a necessary part of the
planning process.The NRF emphasizes the concept of resilient
communities.Resiliency begins with prepared individuals and depends on the leadership and engagement of local
government, civic leaders, and private sector businesses
and organizations.Local police, fire, emergency medical services (EMS), emergency management, public health and medical providers, public works, and other community agencies are often the first to be notified about a threat or
hazard or to respond to an incident.

, fire, emergency medical services (EMS), emergency management, public health and medical providers, public works, and other community agencies are often the first to be notified about a threat or
hazard or to respond to an incident.

These entities should
work with individuals, families, and service providers for people with disabilities and others with access and functional needs to enhance their awareness of risk levels and specific threats, develop household emergency plans that include household pets and service animals, and
prepare emergency supply kits.Concept of Operations
The NRF guides governments at all levels, the private
sector, nongovernmental organizations, and individual citizens toward a shared and effective response.Upon
receiving the warning that a disaster is likely to occur or
has occurred, elements of the NRF may be implemented in a scalable and flexible way to improve response.Functional Organization
The NRF uses 15 Emergency Support Functions (ESF) to
group and describe the kinds of resources and types of
Federal assistance available to augment state and local
response efforts:
  2-3

• ESF #1 Transportation • ESF #8 Public Health and Medical Services
• ESF #2 Communications • ESF #9 Search and Rescue
• ESF #3 Public Works and Engineering • ESF #10 Oil and Hazardous  Materials Response
• ESF #4 Firefighting • ESF #11 Agriculture and Natural Resources
• ESF #5 Emergency Management • ESF #12 Energy
• ESF #6 Mass Care, Emergency
Assistance, Housing, and
Human Services • ESF #13 Public Safety and Security
• ESF #14 Long-Term Community Recovery
• ESF #7 Logistics Management and
Resource Support • ESF #15 External Affairs.Each ESF has a Federal department or agency identified as its coordinator.During response and recovery operations, the coordinating agency forms and activates a team that is responsible for working with the appropriate state and local officials to identify unmet resource needs.The team also coordinates the flow
of resources and assistance provided by the Federal Government to meet these needs.Federal Emergency Plans at th e National and Regional Levels
The NRF serves as the foundation for the development of national and regional response plans that implement Federal response activities.At the national level, the Federal planning structure supports the
NRF.FEMA Regions are developing plans to address potentia l activities and actions taken by regional offices
of Federal departments and agencies in support of state and local operations.They also provide the

of Federal departments and agencies in support of state and local operations.They also provide the
necessary link between the state EOP and the NRF.

Within an identified scope, each Regional plan
addresses one or more of the following:
• Specifies the responsibilities assigned to each of th e tasked Federal departments and agencies for
mobilizing and deploying resources to assist the state(s) in response/recovery efforts
• Describes the relationship between the responding Federal agencies/departments and their state
counterparts
• Provides information to the states on the various  response mechanisms, capabilities, and resources
available to them through the Federal Government
• Describes notification procedures and protocols for communicating with state officials; procedures
and systems for communication; frequency of contact; and message content
• Provides for Incident Management Assistance Team personnel to assist in conducting a rapid
situation assessment immediately prior to or after a disaster has occurred
• Describes coordination responsibilities of the regiona l liaison officer(s) and the provisions established
for deployment to the state EOC
• Provides for deployment of Incident Management Assistance Team members to the state EOC/Joint
Field Office (JFO) and/or staging locations or di rectly into the area impacted by the disaster
• Provides for obtaining work space in the state EOC and other locations for the initial response cadre;
arrangements to obtain work space for the JFO and ot her follow-on response teams; and a variety of
other activities that require extensive coordination.2-4
2.Understanding the Planning Environment: Federal, State, and Local Plans
State, Territorial, and Tribal  Emergency Operations Plans
The state/territorial/tribal EOP addresses several operational response functions and describes how to
fulfill its mission of providing resources to satisfy un met needs.These functions focus on actions, such as
direction and control, warning, p ublic notification, and evacuation, that the state/territorial/tribal
government must take during the initial phase of respon se operations and that fall outside of the Federal
response mission.Thus, they are not appropriate for inclusion in Federal response plans.Because state/territorial/tribal governments must channel Federal assistance provided under the NRF,
some choose to mirror the NRF functions.There is no need to replicate the Fe deral ESFs exactly.

 ESFs exactly.

Some
have successfully used a hybrid approach, either by giving the counterparts of Federal ESFs extra
responsibilities appropriate to the state/territorial/tribal level or by creating functions in addition to those
used by the Federal Government to address state /territorial/tribal responsibilities and concerns.The
important thing is for the choice of functions to fit the state/territorial/tribal government’s own concept of
operations, policies, governmental structure, and r esource base.That fit is critical, because the EOP
describes what the state/territorial/tribal government  will do when conducting emergency operations.The
EOP:
• Identifies the departments and agencies designated to perform response and recovery activities and
specifies tasks they must accomplish
• Outlines the assistance that is available to local ju risdictions during disasters that generate emergency
response and recovery needs beyond what the local jurisdiction can satisfy
• Specifies the direction, control, and communications  procedures and systems that will be relied upon
to alert, notify, recall, and dispatch emergency response personnel; warn local jurisdictions; protect
residents and property; and request aid/support from other jurisdictions and/or the Federal
Government (including the role of the Governor’s Authorized Representative)
• Describes ways to obtain initial situation assessm ent information from the local jurisdiction(s)
directly affected by the disaster or emergency
• Describes how work space and communication suppo rt will be provided to the Regional Liaison
Officers and other Federal teams deployed to the EOC, staging areas, or the area directly impacted by
the disaster
• Designates a State Coordinating Officer to work directly with the Federal Coordinating Officer
• Assists the Federal Coordinating Officer in identif ying candidate locations for establishing the JFO
• Provides coordinating instructions and provisions for implementing interstate compacts, as applicable
• Describes the logistical support for planned operations.Local Emergency Operations Plans

A close analysis of the planning relationships descr ibed in the previous section shows that the FEMA
Region is the interface between the Federal and ju risdictional planning processes.The FEMA Region is
the place where jurisdictional needs dur ing an incident are converted into Federal support missions until a
JFO is established.It is through the FEMA Region that  planning for Federal oper ations is integrated and
synchronized with planning for operations shaped by the hazards and risks faced by state, territorial,
tribal, and local communities.Course of action development determines jurisdictio nal needs during the planning process.Similarly,
FEMA Regions determine capability gaps, resource s hortfalls, and state expectations for Federal
assistance through the process of gap analysis.FEMA Regions conduct these analyses by using a joint
planning team with multiple state representatives, individually with each state, or through some other
method.

 analysis.FEMA Regions conduct these analyses by using a joint
planning team with multiple state representatives, individually with each state, or through some other
method.

To ensure a common operational concept, each Region’ s plan may include an annex that summarizes the
CONOPS, priorities, concerns, and needs of each state within its jurisdiction.In short, the relationships established between the FEMA Region and all Federal, state, and local partners ensure effective collaboration before, during, and after emergency operations.The integrated plans
resulting from these relationships clarify the roles a nd responsibilities at all levels and result in more
effective operations.3.Format and Function:
Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
Overview
The first two chapters provided a foundation for planners by illustrating not only the basics of planning,
but also the environment in which planning occurs.Chapter 3 shifts from theory to application by
examining the different types of plans and how they are used to meet the requirements of a jurisdiction.The Emergency Operations Plan
Traditionally, the focus of a jurisdiction’s operational planning effort has been the EOP.EOPs are plans
that define the scope of preparedness and emergency management activities necessary for that jurisdiction.The EOP structures and concepts that follow provide an example for jurisdictions to use
when developing any plan.The EOP format works well for both conventional and complex emergency
operations.Emergency management involves several kinds of pl ans, just as it involves several kinds of actions.While many jurisdictions consider the EOP the centerpi ece of their planning effort, it is not the only plan
that addresses emergency management  functions.Other types of plans that support and supplement the
EOP are discussed later in this chapter.A jurisdiction’s EOP is a document that:
• Assigns responsibility to organizations and individuals for carrying out specific actions that exceed
routine responsibility at projected times and places during an emergency
• Sets forth lines of authority and organizational relationships and shows how all actions will be
coordinated
• Describes how people (including unaccompanied minor s, individuals with disabilities, others with
access and functional needs, and individuals with limited English proficiency) and property are
protected
• Identifies personnel, equipment, facilities, supp lies, and other resources available within the
jurisdiction or by agreement with other jurisdictions
• Reconciles requirements with other jurisdictions.

An EOP is flexible enough for use in all emergencie s. A complete EOP describes: the purpose of the plan;
the situation; assumptions; CONOPS; organization an d assignment of responsibilities; administration and
logistics; plan development and mainte nance; and authorities and references.3-1
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
The EOP contains annexes appropriate to the juri sdiction’s organization a nd operations.EOPs pre-
designate a jurisdictional lead agency and/or func tional area representatives to the incident command,
unified command, or multiagency coordination entity whenever possible to facilitate responsive and
collaborative incident management.The EOP facilitates prevention, protection, response, and short-term recovery, which sets the stage for
successful long-term recovery.Response actions and some post-disaster recovery issues, such as the
rebuilding and placement of temporary housing faciliti es, are time-sensitive.Advance planning makes
performing these tasks easier, especially in a changing environment.Jurisdictions, especially those with
known severe hazards and vulnerabilities, should in tegrate complex housing and overall recovery
planning with that of the EOP.Typically, an EOP does not detail long-term recovery  actions.However, the EOP should provide for a
transition to a long-term recovery plan, if any ex ists, and for a stand-down of response forces.As
mentioned previously, the EOP may cover some short-term  recovery actions that are natural extensions of
response.For example, meeting human needs requi res maintaining logistical support for mass care
actions initiated in the response phase.It could also involve the restoration of infrastructure “lifelines”
and the removal of debris to facilitate the response.At the state’s discretion, its disaster assistance plans for distribution of Federal and state relief funds might be included as an annex to the EOP.Disaster
assistance plans indicate how to identify, contact, match to aid, certify, and provide support to eligible aid
recipients.State and Local Emergency Operations Plans

Depending on  the nature and size of the emergency, Federal, state, territorial,
tribal, and regional (e.g., the National Capital Re gion) assistance may be provided to the local
jurisdiction.The focus of local and tribal EOPs is on the emergency measures that are essential for
protecting the public.At the minimum, these measures include warning, emergency public information,
evacuation, and shelter.States, territories, and regional organizations play three roles: assisting local jurisdictions whose
capabilities must be augmented or are overwhelmed by an emergency; responding first to certain
emergencies; and working with the Federal Governme nt when Federal assistance is necessary.The state
EOP is the framework within which local EOPs are created and through which the Federal Government
becomes involved.As such, the state EOP ensures that all levels of government are able to mobilize in a
unified way to safeguard the well-being of their citi zens.The state and regional organization EOPs should
synchronize and integrate with local, tribal, and regional plans.A planning team’s main concern is to include all essential information and instructions in the EOP.FEMA does not mandate a particular format for EOPs.In the final analysis, an EOP’s format is
acceptable if users understand it, are comfortable with it, and can extract the information they need.In designing a format for an all-hazards EOP, the planning team should consider the following:
• Organization .Do the EOP section and subsection titles help u sers find what they need, or must users
sift through information that is not relevant?Can single plan components be revised without forcing a
substantial rewrite of the entire EOP?• Progression.In any one section of the EOP, does each elem ent seem to follow from the previous one,
or are some items strikingly out of place?Can the reader grasp the rationale for the sequence and scan
for the information he or she needs?3-2
3.Format and Function: Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
• Consistency.Does each section of the EOP use the same logical progression of elements, or must the
reader reorient himself or herself in each section?• Adaptability.Does the EOP’s organization make its inform ation easy to use during unanticipated
situations?

 use the same logical progression of elements, or must the
reader reorient himself or herself in each section?• Adaptability.Does the EOP’s organization make its inform ation easy to use during unanticipated
situations?

• Compatibility.Does the EOP format promote or hinder coordination with other jurisdictions,
including the state and/or Federal Government?Ca n reformatting the EOP or making a chart of the
coordinating relationships (i.e., a “cros swalk”) solve problems in this area?• Inclusivity .Does the EOP appropriately address the needs of those with disabilities or other access
and functional needs, children, individuals with lim ited English proficiency,  and household pets and
service animals?Structuring an Emergency Operations Plan
While the causes of emergencies vary greatly, their po tential effects do not.Jurisdictions can plan for
effects common to several hazards rather than de velop separate plans for each hazard.For example,
earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes can all force peopl e from their homes.The jurisdiction can develop a
plan organized around the task of finding shelter a nd food for individuals who have been displaced.If
desired, the EOP planners can make minor adjustme nts to reflect differences in the speed of onset,
duration, and intensity of the hazards.This section outlines a variety of formats that a jurisd iction could use when developing an EOP, including
a functional format, an ESF format, and an agency -/department-focused format.These format options
come from EOPs used by jurisdictions across the Nati on.They are suggestions for new planners on where
to begin when developing an EOP.Seasoned planners can use these fo rmats to validate the effectiveness
of their EOP’s organization.The planning team must try to identify all critical common tasks or functions that participating organizations must perform, and assign responsibility for accomplishing each task or function.The
planning team must work with the heads of tasked organizations to en sure that they prepare SOPs/SOGs
detailing how they will carry out critical tasks associated with the jurisdiction’s strategy.Because the
jurisdiction’s goal is a coordinated and integrated re sponse, all EOP styles should flow from a basic plan
that outlines the jurisdiction’s overall emergency organization and its policies.As the planning team begins to develop a new EOP,  members must discuss which format is the most
effective for and applicable to their jurisdiction.

 to develop a new EOP,  members must discuss which format is the most
effective for and applicable to their jurisdiction.

The jurisdiction’s style of government or the results of a
risk assessment may help the team decide which format to use.For example, in a sprawling metropolitan
county that contains several municipalities and has a complex government structure, county emergency
operations may assume more of a coordination and s upport role.Thus, an ESF approach may be optimal
for that county’s EOP.In contrast, a small rural community with a limited government structure and staff that performs multiple duties may benefit from a functi on-based EOP.In short, “form follows function”
in the sense that operational needs should help determ ine the EOP format a jurisdiction uses.Generally,
the functional or agency/department formats are used by local jurisdictions, while the ESF format tends to
be used by larger jurisdictions  and other levels of government.None of these formats are mandatory to achieve NIMS  compliance.The planning team may modify any
of these formats to make the EOP fit the jurisd iction’s emergency management strategy, policy,
resources, and capabilities.Note, however, that some states prescribe an EOP format for their local
governments.3-3
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Traditional Functional Format
The traditional functional structure is probably the mo st commonly used EOP format.This is the format
that many jurisdictions have used to develop EOPs since the 1990s, following FEMA’s Civil
Preparedness Guide 1-8 and State and Local Guide 101,  which have been rescinded and replaced by this
Guide.The traditional functional format has three ma jor sections: the basic plan, functional annexes, and
hazard-specific annexes (see Figure 3.1 ).6
Figure 3.1: Traditional Functional EOP Format
6 The term annex  is used throughout this CPG to refer to functional, s upport, hazard/incident-specific, or  other supplements to the
basic plan, consistent with the NRF.So me jurisdictions’ plans may use the term appendix  in the same fashion (e.g., hazard-specific
appendix).3-4

 Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
The basic plan provides an overview of the jurisd iction’s preparedness and response strategies.

It
describes expected hazards, outlines agency roles and responsibilities, and explains how the jurisdiction
keeps the plan current.The functional annexes are individual chapters that focus on missions (e.g., communications, damage assessment).These annexes describe th e actions, roles, and responsibilities of participating organizations.Functional annexes discuss how the jurisdiction manages the function before, during, and after the emergency, and they identify the agencies that impl ement that function.However, each functional annex
addresses only general strategies used for any emergency.The hazard-, threat-, or incident-specific annex es describe the policies, situation, CONOPS, and
responsibilities for particular hazards, threats, or incide nts.They explain the procedures that are unique to
that annex for a hazard type.For example, the dir ection and control annex may discuss how a local law
enforcement’s command post would coordinate its func tions; this information would only be addressed in
a hazard-, threat-, or incident-specific annex if it w ould be different for partic ular hazards, threats, or
incidents.Strategies already outlined in a functional annex should not be repeated in a hazard-specific annex.The traditional format also uses a sp ecific outline to define the elements  of each annex.When the format
is followed, EOP users can find information in the pl an more easily because the same type of information
is in the same location.The traditional EOP format is flexible enough to accommodate all jurisdictional
strategies.The planning team can add annexes to in clude a new function or a newly identified hazard or
threat.Similarly, the team can separate an operationa l issue (e.g., mass care) into two separate annexes
(e.g., sheltering and feeding, distribution of emergency supplies).Emergency Support Function Format
The ESF format is the plan structure used in the NRF.Many state-level EOPs use this format.It begins
with a basic plan, includes unique annexes that s upport the whole plan, addresses individual ESF annexes,
and then attaches separate support or incident annexes (see Figure 3.2 ).3-5

agencies that have the lead for a given ESF.The basic plan then outlines the ESFs activated during an
emergency.3-6
3.Format and Function: Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
The ESF annexes identify the ESF coordinator and the primary and support agencies for each function.ESFs with multiple primary agencies should designate an ESF coordinator to coordinate pre-incident
planning.An ESF annex describes expected mission execution for each emergency phase and identifies
tasks assigned to members of the ESF, including  nongovernmental and private sector partners.The support annexes describe the framework through which a jurisdiction’s departments and agencies, the
private sector, not-for-profit and voluntary organi zations, and other nongovernmental organizations
coordinate and execute the common emergency manage ment strategies.The actions described in the
support annexes apply to nearly every type of emer gency.Each support annex identifies a coordinating
agency, as well as assisting and cooperating agencies.In some instances, two departments or agencies
share coordinating agency responsibilities.The hazard-, threat-, or incident-specific annex es describe the policies, situation, CONOPS, and
responsibilities for particular hazards, threats, or in cidents.Each annex should consider the following
components:
• Policies .The policy section identifies the authorities unique to the incident type, the special actions or
declarations that may result, and any special policies that may apply.• Situation.The situation section describes the incident or hazard characteristics and the planning
assumptions.It also outlines the management appr oach for those instances when key assumptions do
not hold (e.g., how authorities will operate if th ey lose communication with senior decision makers).• Concept of Operations .This section describes the flow of the emergency management strategy for
accomplishing a mission or set of objectives in order to reach a desired end-state.It identifies special
coordination structures, specialized response team s or resources needed, and other considerations

in an incident-, hazard-, or threat-specific response.

Agency-/Department-Focused Format
The agency-/department-focused format addresses each department’s or agency’s tasks in a separate
section.In addition to the basic plan, this format includes lead and support agency sections and hazard-
specific procedures for the individual agencies (see Figure 3.3 ).Very small communities may find this
format more appropriate for their situation than the other formats previously presented.3-7
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Figure 3.3: Agency-/Department-Focused EOP Format
Like the other EOP formats, the basic plan provides an overview of a jurisdic tion’s ability to prevent,
protect against, respond to, and recover from emergenci es.It summarizes the basic tasks taken to prepare
for a disaster and defines how the plan is developed and maintained.Separate lead and support agency sections discuss the emergency functions completed by individual
departments, agencies, and nongovernmental partners.E ach individual agency section still needs to refer
to other agency sections to ensure coordination with their respective emergency management strategies.The hazard-specific procedures section addresses the unique preparedness, response, and recovery strategies relevant to each department or agency for specific disaster types.The hazard-specific
procedures can immediately follow each agency section or  be attached as a separat e chapter to the plan.This format allows EOP users to review only those pr ocedures specific to their agency without having to
review other agencies’ response tasks.The individual sections still reference the unique relationships that
need to exist with other agencies during a disaster; however, they do not contain details on the other
departments’ or agencies’ strategies.If needed, th e plan users can go to the other departments’ or
agencies’ sections and review their procedures to understand the bigger picture.The level of detail
provided in each section varies according to the needs of the specific department or agency.Agencies or departments with detailed SOPs/SOGs may not need much information in their portion of the plan, while others may need to provide more details in the EOP.3-8

 Plan for the Job
Using Planning Templates
Managers and planners, particularly at the local level, recognize that the planning process demands a
significant commitment of time, effort, and resources.

To ease this burden, many planners and
jurisdictions use templates to complete their plan s. Some states provide templates to their local
jurisdictions.Other templates are available through hazard-specific preparedness programs or commercially from private sector vendors.Planners must ensure that using those templates does not undermine the planning process.For example, “fill-in-the-blank” templates can defeat the socializati on, mutual learning, and role acceptance that are so
important to achieving effective planning and a successf ul response.The best templates are those that
offer a plan format and describe the content that each  section might contain, allowing for tailoring to the
jurisdiction’s geographic, political, and social environm ent.With this in mind, planners should consider
CPG 101 a template because it provides plan formats and content guidance.When using a planning template, pl anners should consider whether:
• The resulting plan represents the jurisdiction’s unique hazard and threat situation by ensuring that the underlying facts and assumptions match those applicable to the jurisdiction
• The hazard and risk assessments match the jurisdic tion’s demographics, infrastructure inventory,
probability of hazard occurrence, etc.• The template broadly identifies the resources n eeded to address the problems generated by an
emergency or disaster
• Using the template stifles creativity and flexibility,  thereby constraining the development of strategies
and tactics needed to solve disaster problems
• Using the templates encourages planning “in a vacuum,” by allowing a single individual to “write” the plan.Regardless of the template used, planners will likely disc over that the template will need to be adjusted to
meet their jurisdiction’s needs.This observation does not  mean that planners should not use templates or
plans from other jurisdictions to help with writing styl e and structure.Instead, what it does mean is that
planners must evaluate the usefulness of any planning tool (e.g., template, software) used as part of the
planning process.Additional Types of Plans
Emergency operations involve several kinds of plans, just as they involve several kinds of actions.While
the EOP is often the centerpiece of emergency planni ng efforts, it is not the only plan that addresses
emergency management or homeland security missions.There are other types of plans that support and
supplement the EOP and its annexes.

anni ng efforts, it is not the only plan that addresses
emergency management or homeland security missions.There are other types of plans that support and
supplement the EOP and its annexes.

Joint Operational Plans or Regional Coordination Plans typically involve multiple levels of government to address a specific incident or a special  event.These plans should be developed in a manner
consistent with this Guide and included as an anne x or supplemental plan to the EOP, depending on the
subject of the plan.Standing plans should be an a nnex to the related EOPs, while special events plans
should be stand-alone supplements based on the information contained with in the related EOPs.Administrative plans describe basic policies and procedures to support a governmental endeavor.Typically, they deal less with external work produc ts than with internal processes.Examples include
  3-9
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
plans for financial management, pe rsonnel management, records review, and labor relations activities.Such plans are not the direct concern of an EOP.However, planners should reference the administrative
plan in the EOP if its provisions apply during an em ergency.Planners should make similar references in
the EOP for exceptions to normal administrative plans permitted during an emergency.Preparedness plans address the process for developing and maintaining capabilities for the whole
community both pre- and post-incident.Prep aredness plans should address capabilities needed for
prevention, protection, response, recovery, and mitigation activities.These plans include the schedule for identifying and meeting training needs based on the expectations created by the EOP; the process and
schedule for developing, conducting, and evaluating exercises and correcting identified deficiencies; and plans for procuring, retrofitting, or building faciliti es and equipment that could withstand the effects of
the hazards facing the jurisdiction.Continuity plans  outline essential functions that must be performed during an incident that disrupts
normal operations and the methods by which these func tions will be performed.They also describe the
process for timely resumption of normal operations once the emergency has ended.COOP plans address the continued performance of core capabilities and cr itical operations during any potential incident.COG
plans address the preservation and/or reconstitution of government to ensure that constitutional,
legislative, and/or administra tive responsibilities are maintained.Recovery plans  developed prior to a disaster enable jurisdic tions to effectively direct recovery activities
and expedite a unified recovery effort.

 a disaster enable jurisdic tions to effectively direct recovery activities
and expedite a unified recovery effort.

Pre-incident  planning performed in conjunction with community
development planning helps to establish recovery priorities, incorporate mitigation strategies in the wake of an incident, and identify options and changes that should be considered or implemented after an incident.Post-incident community reco very planning serves to integrate the range of complex decisions in
the context of the incident and works as the foundation for allocating resources.Mitigation plans  outline a jurisdiction’s strategy for mitig ating the hazards it faces.The Disaster
Mitigation Act of 2000 requires jurisdictions seeking certain disaster assistance funding to have approved
mitigation plans.Mitigation planning is often a long-term effort and may be part of or tied to the
jurisdiction’s strategic development plan or similar documents.Mitigation planning committees may differ from operational planning teams in that they include zoning boards, floodplain managers, and individuals with long-term cultural or economic in terests.Existing plans for mitigating hazards are
relevant to an EOP since both originate from a h azard-based analysis and share similar component
requirements.Prevention and protection plans  typically tend to be more facility focused and procedural or tactical in
their content.Common jurisdictional prevention and protection plans include fusion center operations
plans, sector-specific or CIKR security plans, and incident-specific c ontingency action plans.Procedural Documents
Procedural documents describe how to accomplish specific activities needed to finish a task or achieve a
goal or objective.Put simply, plans describe the “w hat” and procedures describe the “how.” Planners
should prepare procedural documents to keep the pl an free of unnecessary detail.The basic criterion is:
What does the audience of this part of the plan need to know or have set out as a matter of public record?Information and how-to instructions used by an indi vidual or small group should appear in procedural
documents.The plan should reference procedural documents as appropriate.With regard to many responsibilities in the EOP, it is enough to assign the responsibility to an individual
(by position or authority) or organization and specify the assignee’s accountability: to whom does the

For example, a plan assigning responsibility for
extinguishing fires to the fire department would not detail procedures used at the scene or specify what
fire equipment is most appropriate.In this situa tion, the EOP would defer to the fire department’s
SOPs/SOGs.However, the plan would describe the relationship between the Incident Commander and the
central organization directing the jurisdictional respon se to the emergency, of which the fire in question
may be only a part.Overviews are brief concept summaries of an incident-rela ted function, team, or capability.There are two
types of overview documents.One type explains general protocols and procedures.This document serves
as the bridge between all functional or hazard-specific  planning annexes and procedural documentation.It
could contain an EOC layout, describe activation le vels, and identify which f unctions or sections are
responsible for planning, operati onal, and support activities.An easy way to develop an overview
document is to review the assignments and responsib ilities outlined in the EOP and ensure that the
overview document references the procedures develope d to fulfill them.The second type of overview
document is specific to a functional team or area.It describes the general responsibilities and tasks of a
functional team.This overview document provides enough  information to supporting personnel to aid in
activities related to the function, team, or cap ability summarized by the document.It identifies
qualifications to support the team, provides a summary  of operational procedures, and defines possible
missions in greater detail than is described in pl an annexes.As an example, the overview document
addressing transportation would describe the purpose of  this function, compos ition of support personnel,
requirements for the team or branch, and missions that might be required.It might also identify the
hazards or conditions that determine when missions are assigned.A successful overview document helps orient a newly arriving member of the department or agency brought in to support a particular function, mission, or section.Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)/Standard
Operating Guidelines (SOG)  are complete reference
documents that provide the purpose, authorities,
duration, and details of the preferred method for performing a single function or a number of
interrelated functions in a uniform manner.

 of the preferred method for performing a single function or a number of
interrelated functions in a uniform manner.

SOPs/SOGs often describe processes that evolved institutionally over the years or document common practices so that institutional experience is not lost to the organization as a result of staff turnover.SOPs/SOGs are sometimes task-specific (e.g., how to activate a siren system or issue an Emergency Alert
System [EAS] message).SOPs/SOGs should grow na turally out of the responsibilities identified and
described in the EOP.Staff members who typically engage in emergency activities should develop the
procedures found in an SOP/SOG.SOPs/SOGs may include checklists, call-down
rosters, resource listings, maps, and charts.SOPs/SOGs may also describe how to notify
staff; how to obtain  and use equipment,
supplies, and vehicles; how to obtain mutual aid; how to report information  to organizational work
centers and the EOC; and how to communicate with staff members who are operating from more tha n one location.The planning team works with the senior representatives of tasked or ganizations to ensure that the
SOPs/SOGs needed to implement the EOP do, in fact, exist and do not conflict with the EOP or with one
another.Field Operations Guides (FOG) or handbooks  are durable pocket or desk guides containing information
required to perform specific assignments or functions.FOGs provide those individuals assigned to specific teams, branches, or functions with informati on about the procedures they are likely to perform or
portions of an SOP/SOG appropriate for the missions they are likely to complete.The FOG is a short-
form version of the SOP/SOG and serves as a res ource document.When combined with the overview
document, it gives an accurate and complete picture of  the positions these individuals fill.In addition to
relevant procedures, the FOG or handbook may include administrative procedures that staff must follow.3-11

Job aids  are checklists or other materials that help users perform a task.Examples of job aids include

 machine operating instructions, and task lists.Job aids are
often included to help relatively inexperienced EO C personnel complete their assigned tasks or as a
reference for experienced personnel.

Job aids may also  reduce complexity or the opportunity for error in
executing a task (e.g., providing a lookup chart of temperature conversions rather than providing a
formula for doing the conversion).These job aids do not eliminate the need for training, but may serve to
address gaps in training during an incident.Emergency Operations Plan Content
The Basic Plan
The basic plan provides an overview of the jurisdiction’s approach to emergency operations.It identifies emergency response policies, describes the response or ganization, and assigns tasks.Although the basic
plan guides the development of the more operationally-o riented annexes, its primary audience consists of
the jurisdiction’s senior official, his or her staff, agency heads, and the commun ity (as appropriate).The
elements listed in this section should meet the n eeds of this audience while providing a solid foundation
for the development of supporting annexes.Introductory Material
Certain items that enhance accountability and ease of use should preface an EOP.Typical introductory
material includes the following components:
• Cover Page .The cover page has the title of the plan.It should include a date and identify the
jurisdiction(s) covered by the plan.• Promulgation Document .Promulgation is the process that offi cially announces/declares a plan (or
law).The promulgation document gives the plan official status.It gives both the authority and the
responsibility to organizations to perform their t asks.It should also mention the responsibilities of
tasked organizations with regard to preparing and maintaining their own procedures/guidelines and
commit those organizations to carrying out the trai ning, exercises, and plan maintenance needed to
support the plan.In addition, the promulgation docu ment allows senior officials to affirm their
support for emergency management.• Approval and Implementation Page .The approval and implementation page introduces the plan,
outlines its applicability, and indicates that it super sedes all previous plans.It should include a
delegation of authority for specific modifications that can be made to the plan and by whom they can
be made without the senior official’s signature.It should also include a date and should be signed by
the senior official(s) (e.g., governor, tribal lead er[s], mayor, county judge, commissioner[s]).• Record of Changes .

 a date and should be signed by
the senior official(s) (e.g., governor, tribal lead er[s], mayor, county judge, commissioner[s]).• Record of Changes .

Each update or change to the plan should be tracked.The record of changes,
usually in table format, contains, at a minimum, a ch ange number, the date of the change, the name of
the person who made the change, and a summary of the change.Other relevant information could be
considered.• Record of Distribution .The record of distribution, usually in  table format, indicates the title and the
name of the person receiving the plan, the agency to which the recipient belongs, the date of delivery,
and the number of copies delivered.Other relevant information could be considered.The record of
distribution can be used to prove that tasked i ndividuals and organizations  have acknowledged their
receipt, review, and/or acceptance of the plan.Copies of the plan can be made available to the public
and media without SOPs/SOGs, call-down lis ts, or other sensitive information.3-12
3.Format and Function: Identifying the Right Plan for the Job
• Table of Contents .The table of contents should be a logically  ordered and clearly identified layout of
the major sections and subsections of the plan th at will make finding information within the plan
easier.Purpose, Scope, Situation Overview, and Planning Assumptions
The purpose, scope, situation overview, and pl anning assumptions section includes the following
components:
• Purpose .The purpose sets the foundation for the rest of the EOP.The basic plan’s purpose is a
general statement of what the EOP is meant to do.The statement should be supported by a brief
synopsis of the basic plan and annexes.• Scope .The EOP should also explicitly state the scope  of emergency and disaster response and the
entities (e.g., departments, agencies, private sector , citizens) and geographic areas to which the plan
applies.• Situation Overview .The situation section characterizes the “planning environment,” making it clear
why an EOP is necessary.The level of detail is a matter of judgment; some information may be
limited to a few specific annexes and presented there.At a minimum, the situation section should
summarize hazards faced by the jurisdiction and discu ss how the jurisdiction expects to receive (or
provide) assistance within its regional response stru ctures.

 situation section should
summarize hazards faced by the jurisdiction and discu ss how the jurisdiction expects to receive (or
provide) assistance within its regional response stru ctures.

The situation section covers a general
discussion of:
– Relative probability and impact of the hazards
– Geographic areas likely to be affected by particular hazards
– Vulnerable critical facilities (e.g., nursing homes, schools, hospitals, infrastructure)
– Population distribution and locations, including any concentrated populations of individuals with
disabilities, others with access and functional n eeds, or individuals with limited English
proficiency, as well as unaccompanied minors a nd children in daycare and school settings
– Dependencies on other jurisdictions for critical resources
– The process used by the jurisdiction to determine its capabilities and limits in order to prepare for
and respond to the defined hazards
– The actions taken in advance to minimize an inci dent’s impacts, including short- and long-term
strategies.• Planning Assumptions .These identify what the planning team assumes to be facts for planning
purposes in order to make it possible to execute the EOP.During operations, the assumptions indicate
areas where adjustments to the plan have to be made as the facts of the incident become known.These also provide the opportunity to communicate th e intent of senior officials regarding emergency
operations priorities.Concept of Operations (CONOPS)
The audience for the basic plan need s to be able to visualize the sequence and scope of the planned
emergency response.The CONOPS section is a written or graphic statement that explains in broad terms
the decision maker’s or leader’s intent with rega rd to an operation.The CONOPS should describe how
the response organization accomplishes a mission or set of objectives in order to reach a desired end-state.Ideally, it offers clear methodology to realize the goals and objectives to execute the plan.This may
include a brief discussion of the activation levels iden tified by the jurisdiction for its operations center.The CONOPS should briefly address direction and control, alert and warning, and continuity matters that
may be dealt with more fully in annexes.3-13
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Organization and Assignment of Responsibilities
The basic plan establishes the operational organization that will be relied on to respond to an emergency
situation.It includes a list of the kinds of tasks to  be performed, by position and organization, without all
of the procedural details included in functional annexes.

 of the kinds of tasks to  be performed, by position and organization, without all
of the procedural details included in functional annexes.

When two or more organizations perform the same kind of task, one should be given primary r esponsibility, with the other(s) providing a supporting
role.For the sake of clarity, a matrix of organiza tions and areas of responsibility (including functions)
should be included to summarize the primary and sup porting roles.Shared general responsibilities, such
as developing SOPs/SOGs, should not be neglected, and the matrix might include organizations not under jurisdictional control, if they have  defined responsibilities for responding to emergencies that might occur
in the jurisdiction.Organization charts, especially t hose depicting how a jurisdiction is implementing the
ICS or Multiagency Coordination System structure, ar e helpful.This section should also outline agency
and departmental roles related to prevention and protection activities.In addition, this section is where a jurisdiction discu sses the option that it uses for organizing emergency
management—ESF, agency and depa rtment, functional areas of ICS/NIMS, or a hybrid.The selected
management structure determines what types of annexes are included in the EOP and should be carried through to any hazard annexes.Direction, Control, and Coordination
This section describes the framework for all direction, control, and coordination activities.It identifies
who has tactical and operational control of res ponse assets.Additionally, Direction, Control, and
Coordination explains how multijurisd ictional coordination systems support the efforts of organizations to
coordinate efforts across jurisdictions while allowing each jurisdiction to retain its own authorities.This
section also provides information on how department and agency plans nest into the EOP (horizontal
integration) and how higher-level plans are expected to layer on the EOP (vertical integration).Information Collection, Analysis, and Dissemination
This section describes the critical or essential information common to a ll operations identified during the
planning process.It identifies the type of information needed, the source of the information, who uses the
information, how the information is shared, the format for providing the information, and any specific times the information is needed.State and local prevention and protection assets must develop the Information Collection, Analysis, and Dissemination section in close cooperation with each other.The
contents of this section are best provided in a tabul ar format.This section may be expanded as an annex.

Communications
This section describes the communication protocols a nd coordination procedures used between response
organizations during emergencies and disaster s. It discusses the framework for delivering
communications support and how the jurisdiction’s comm unications integrate into the regional or national
disaster communications network.It does not describ e communications hardware or specific procedures
found in departmental SOPs/SOGs.Planners shoul d identify and summarize separate interoperable
communications plans.This section may be expande d as an annex and is usually supplemented by

preparedness phase
• Assign responsibility for the overall planning  and coordination to a specific position
• Provide for a regular cycle of training, eval uating, reviewing, and updating of the EOP.Authorities and References
This section provides the legal basis for emergency operations and activities.

 emergency operations and activities.

This section of the plan
includes:
• Lists of laws, statutes, ordinances, executive orders , regulations, and formal agreements relevant to
emergencies (e.g., MAAs)
• Specification of the extent and limits of the emergency authorities granted to the senior official,
including the conditions under which these authoriti es become effective and when they would be
terminated
• Pre-delegation of emergency authorities (i.e., enab ling measures sufficient to ensure that specific
emergency-related authorities can be exercised by the elected or appointed leadership or their
designated successors)
• Provisions for COOP and COG (e.g., the succession of decision-making authority and operational
control) to ensure that critical em ergency functions can be performed.Supporting Annexes
What follows is a discussion of the purpose and potential content of supporting annexes to the basic plan.For consistency, the recommended structure for all annexes is the same as that of the basic plan.Functional, Support, Emergency Phase, or Agency-Focused Annex Content
Functional, support, emergency phase, or agency-focu sed annexes add specific information and direction
to the EOP.These annexes are variations of functional annexes tailored to the EOP format used by the
jurisdiction.They focus on critical operational func tions and who is responsib le for carrying them out.These annexes clearly describe the policies, process es, roles, and responsibilities that agencies and
departments carry out before, during, and after any emergency.While the basic plan provides broad,
overarching information relevant to the EOP as a wh ole, these annexes focus on specific responsibilities,
tasks, and operational actions that pertain to th e performance of a particular emergency operations
function.These annexes also establish preparedness ta rgets (e.g., training, exercises, equipment checks

related goals and objectives  during emergencies and
disasters.Planners should ensure that  specific concerns

proficiencyAn early and very important planning task is to identify
the functions that are critical to successful emergency response.These core functions become the subjects of the separate functional, support, emergency phase, or agency-focused annexes.The constitutional and
organizational structures of a jurisdiction’s government,
the capabilities of its emergency services agencies, and established policy and intended outcome of emergency operations influence the choice of core functions.While no single list of functions applies to all jurisdictions, the
following list of core functions warrants special
attention because they may require specific actions during emergency response operations:
•Direction, control, and coordination
•Information collection, analysis, and dissemination
•Communications
•Population warning
•Emergency public information
•Public protection
•Mass care and emergency assistance
•Health and medical services
•Resource management.This list of core functions is not comprehensive.Each jurisdiction must assess its own needs, and
additional or different annexes from those identified in Appendix C should be prepared at the planning team’s discretion.States should encourage their jurisd ictions to use a consistent set of core emergency
functions to facilitate coordination and interoperability.Some jurisdictions may want to modify their functional annex structure to use the 15 ESFs identified in
the NRF.Some communities that have adopted the ESF approach have also added additional ESFs to
meet local needs.The ESF structure facilitates the orderly flow of local requests for governmental support
to the state and Federal levels and the provision of  resources back down to local government during an
emergency.State and local jurisdictions that choose not to adopt the ESF structure should cross-reference
their functional annexes with the ESFs.Table 3.1  shows some possible  relationships between the traditi onal emergency management core
functions, the department/agency, and ESF structures.3-16

Hazard-, Threat-, or Incident-Specific Annexes
The contents of hazard-, threat-, or incident-sp ecific annexes focus on the special planning needs
generated by the subject hazard.

These annexes contai n unique and regulatory response details that apply
to a single hazard.Depending upon the EOP’s structure, hazard-specific information may be included in
functional annexes rather than sta nd-alone hazard-specific annexes.Hazard- or incident-specific annexes usually identify hazard-specific risk areas and evacuation routes, specify provisions and protocols for warning the pub lic and disseminating emergency public information,
and specify the types of protective equipment and detection devices for responders.The annexes have
tabs that serve as work aids for items including maps , charts, tables, checklists, resource inventories, and
summaries of critical information.As indicated pr eviously, hazard-specific annexes follow the basic
plan’s content organization.Hazard-specific operations  information is typically provided in the CONOPS
section, and includes:
• Assessment and control of the hazard
• Identification of unique prevention and CIKR protect ion activities to be undertaken to address the
hazard or threat, as appropriate
• Selection of protective actions
• Conduct of public warning
• Implementation of protective actions
• Implementation of short-term stabilization actions
• Implementation of recovery actions.Annex Implementing Instructions
Each annex, as well as the basic plan, may use impl ementing instructions in the form of SOPs/SOGs,
maps, charts, tables, forms, and checklists and may be included as attachments or references.The EOP
planning team may use supporting documents, as needed, to clarify the contents of the plan or annex.For
example, the evacuation annex may be made clearer by  attaching maps marked with evacuation routes to
it.Because these routes may change depending on the location of the hazard, hazard-specific maps may
also be included in the evacuation annex.Similarly,  the locations of shelters may be marked on maps
supporting the mass care annex.3-18

This page intentionally left blank.4.The Planning Process
Overview
This chapter merges information from the first three chapters and describes an approach for operational
planning that is consistent with processes already fa miliar to most planners.Wh en the planning process is
used consistently during the preparedness phase, its use during operations becomes second nature.The
goal is to make the planning process routine acro ss all phases of emergency management and for all
homeland security mission areas.The process described in this chapter blends concepts from a variety of s ources.It applies at all levels of
government and allows private and nongovernmental orga nizations to integrate with government planning
efforts.Although individual planners can use this proc ess, it is most effective when used by a planning
team.Steps in the Planning Process
There are many ways to produce an EOP.The pla nning process that follows is flexible and allows
communities to adapt it to varying characteristics and s ituations.While not ideal, if time is a constraint,
steps can be minimized or skipped in order to accel erate the process.Small communities can follow just
the steps that are appropriate to their size, known risks, and available planning resources.Figure 4.1
depicts steps in the planning process.At each step in the planning pr ocess, jurisdictions should consider
the impact of the decisions made on training, exercises, equipment, and other requirements.Figure 4.1: Steps in the Planning Process

Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Step 1: Form a Collaborative Planning Team Case Study: A Small Community
Planning Team
A small community took the following
approach to forming its planning team:
Who was involved in the core planning
team?The core planning team was composed of
any department or office that was likely to be involved in most, if not all, responses.The five to seven most central people in
this community were: the Fire and Police
Chiefs, the Emergency Manager and the Planner, and the Head of Public Works.What did they do?

 the Fire and Police
Chiefs, the Emergency Manager and the Planner, and the Head of Public Works.What did they do?

Studied the composition of the
population
within the community
Provided information to create a
complete draft plan
Answered questions about the
community
 for the draft plan
Provided additional commentary on
roles and respons
ibilities
Gave information about the
community’s standard operations
Clarified command structures
Provided information about resources,
capabilities, threats, and risks
Gave writers information for integration
Who participated in the expanded
planning team?The expanded planning team included
responders and stakeholders who might become involved in a major incident.In this case, the community used a 10- to 20-
member group that included emergency
managers from surrounding communities, business leaders, secondary responders, representatives from industry, community
leaders (including leaders from the
disability community), and community contractors.What did they do?Reviewed  the full plan
Provided insights and
recommendations for improvement
Integrated additional perspectives
Agreed to provide additional supportExperience and lessons learned indicate that operational
planning is best performed by a team.Using a team or group approach helps organizations define the role they will play
during an operation.Case studies and research reinforce this
concept by pointing out that the common thread found in
successful operations is that pa rticipating organizations have
understood and accepted their roles.In addition, members of the planning team should be able to understand and accept the roles of other departments and agencies.One goal of
using a planning team is to build and expand relationships
that help bring creativity and innovation to planning during an incident.This approach help s establish a planning routine,
so that processes followed before an incident occurs are the
same as those used during and following an incident.A community benefits from the active participation of all
stakeholders.Some tips for gathering the team together include the following:
•Plan ahead .The planning team should receive plenty of
notice about where and when the planning meeting will
be held.If time permits, ask the team members to
identify the time(s) and place(s) that will work for thegroup.•Provide information about team expectations .

s) and place(s) that will work for thegroup.•Provide information about team expectations .

Planners
should explain why participating on the planning team isimportant to the participants’ agencies and to thecommunity itself, showing the participants how their
contributions will lead to more effective operations.In
addition, budget and other pr oject management concerns
should be outlined early in the process.•Ask the senior elected or appointed official or designee
to sign the meeting announcement .A directive from the
executive office carries the author ity of the senior official
and sends a clear signal that the participants are expected
to attend and that operational planning is important to the
community.•Allow flexibility in scheduling after the first meeting .Not all team members will need to attend all meetings.Insome cases, task forces or  subcommittees can complete
the work.When the planning team chooses to use thisoption, it should provide project guidance (e.g., timeframes, milestones) but let the subcommittee membersdetermine when it is most convenient to meet.•Consider using external facilitators .Third-party
facilitators can perform a vital function by keeping the
process focused and mediating disagreements.4-2
4.The Planning Process
The key to planning in a group setting is to allow open and frank discussion during the process.Interaction among planners can help elicit a co mmon operational unders tanding.Individual group
members must be encouraged to express objections or doubts.If a planner disagrees with a proposed solution, that planner must also identify what needs to be fixed.Identify Core Planning Team
In most jurisdictions, the emergency manager or homel and security manager is the senior official’s policy
advisor for prevention, protection, response, rec overy, and mitigation strategies, as well as overall
preparedness.The emergency manager or homeland s ecurity manager may also be the prevention and
protection advisor, if that role is not given to a law enforcement official or other designated advisor.In
these roles, emergency managers or homeland security  managers are often responsible for coordinating
and developing an EOP, filling the role of lead plan ner.This means that the emergency manager provides
oversight to a jurisdiction’s planning team.Howeve r, other government agencies or departments may
have statutory authority and responsibility that overlaps or complements this responsibility.For example,
law enforcement often has the lead in addressing pr evention and protection, while public health addresses
unique epidemiological issues.

 statutory authority and responsibility that overlaps or complements this responsibility.For example,
law enforcement often has the lead in addressing pr evention and protection, while public health addresses
unique epidemiological issues.

It is important to include a hazard mitigation expe rt on the planning team.Mitigation planners are a
valuable resource for information concerning hazard an alysis, functional vulnerabilities, critical facilities,
and funding availability.Includi ng mitigation promotes continuity throughout emergency planning and
helps reduce the number of physical constraints by leveraging resources to address anticipated operational
requirements.Increasingly, emergency management agencies are hiring permanent staff and/or contracting subject
matter experts to provide expertise on disability, acce ss and functional needs, children, and household
pets and service animals for the emergency planning process.These experts provide critical perspectives
and information to ensure individuals with disab ilities, others with access and functional needs, and
individuals with limited English proficiency are fully integrated into EOPs.These experts can also help
ensure compliance with anti-discrimination laws.Even at this early stage, planners
should begin thinking about the impact
of who is involved in the planning process, as it will have a major impact
on preparedness and operational
requirements.For example, if there is no hazardous
materials response capability in a
jurisdiction, planners will need to consider how to obtain that capability (through agreements)  or develop that
capability (through equipment, training, licensing, etc.).Conversely, failure to include groups
in planning (such as advocates for
those with access or functional needs) will lead to mistakes and/or shortfalls
in capability and resource
requirements.The planner must ensure that operational planning involves the
jurisdiction’s entire emergency management and homeland security team.Initially, the team should be small, consisting of
planners from the organizations that usually participate in emergency or homeland security operations.They form the core for all planning efforts.As an EOP matures, the core team
expands to include other planners.

Jurisdictions that use an agency and department operational
structure might use a core team consisting of planners from the following:
•Emergency management
•Law enforcement
•Fire services
•EMS
•Public health
4-3
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
• Hospitals and health care facilities
• Public works
• Utility operators
• Education
• Agriculture
• Animal control
• Social services
• Childcare, child welfare, and juvenile  justice facilities (including courts)
• National Guard
• Private sector
• Civic, social, faith-based, educational, professiona l, and advocacy organizations (e.g., those that
address disability and access and functional needs issues, children’s issues, immigrant and
racial/ethnic community concerns, animal welfare, and service animals).A jurisdiction might want to base the core planning team’s membership on the EOP structure it uses.For example, jurisdictions using an ESF structure might form  a core team composed of planners from the lead
agencies or departments for ESF #4 (Fire), ESF #5 (Emergency Management), ESF #6 (Mass Care), ESF #8 (Public Health and Medical Services), and ESF #13 (Public Safety).Note that these ESF titles are
examples.While the Federal naming convention is pref erred for consistency, a jurisdiction should use its
local ESF naming convention in its plans.Regardless of the core planning team structure, the involvement of executives from the member agencies,
departments, or CIKR organizations (where appropriate) is critical.They are able to speak with authority
on policy, provide subject matter expertise, and pr ovide accountability as it relates to their agency or
department.Engaging the Whole Community in Planning
Engaging in community-based planning—planning that is for the whole community and involves the
whole community—is crucial to the success of any pl an.Determining how to effectively engage the
community in this planning process is one of the bi ggest challenges faced by planners.This challenge
may be built on misperceptions about a community’s in terest in participating in the process, security
concerns about involving those outside government, or a failure to jointly and adequately define the role
of the community in the planning process.

 about involving those outside government, or a failure to jointly and adequately define the role
of the community in the planning process.

Community leaders have a keen understanding about their community’s needs and capabilities and are a valuable  stakeholder that can support the planning process
in many ways.Community-based planning should also include notifying affected, protected groups of
opportunities to participate in planning activities a nd making such activities accessible to the entire
community (e.g., use of interprete rs and translated announcements).Communities may or may not be geographically cons trained.Geographic communities are generally the
basis for emergency management agencies and are constructed around political boundaries.The geographic community includes a number of communities of interest.These communities of interest are
not necessarily confined to the borders of a jurisdic tion and may center on physical, social, cultural, or
philosophical structures.Examples include:
• Civic, social, faith-based, educational, professional, and advocacy organizations

• Immigrant and limited English proficiency constituencies Case Studies: Private Sector
Partnerships
Arlington County, Virginia has developed the “Safer Arlington
Partnership,” a program engaging
non-profit, private sector, and public sector organizations in which members work together to enhance
the level of preparedness in the
County.The program’s mission is achieved through four task forces:
Training and Exercises, Information
and Tools, Resource Inventory and Management, and Education and Outreach.More information regarding
this initiative can be found at
http://www.fema.gov/ pdf/privatesector/
safer_arlington_partnership.pdf.Several large metropolitan areas have
also integrated the private sector into their catastrophic planning activities, including Honolulu (pandemic
planning), Los Angeles/ Long Beach
(disaster housing), National Capital Region (evacuation and contra-flow),
New York/New Jersey (infrastructure
protection, disaster housing), Norfolk (commodities and resource management), and Seattle
(evacuation and sheltering).• Voluntary organizations
• Private service providers
• Critical infrastructure operators
• Local and regional corporations.The private sector is a critical component in community engagement.Not only are they often the primary providers of
critical services to the public, they also possess knowledge and
resources to supplement and enhance preparedness, response, and recovery efforts.


critical services to the public, they also possess knowledge and
resources to supplement and enhance preparedness, response, and recovery efforts.

Often, private sector and government missions overlap—early coordination ensures effective sharing of information and resources and facilitates the establishment of
common goals and objectives.Private sector engagement presents unique challenges.The private sector plays a critical role in any disaster, and it is important to ensure they are active particip ants in the process, including
involvement in jurisdictional training and exercise programs.An effective outreach program is critical in developing these partnerships.Disasters begin and end locally.After the response is over, it is the local community that lives with the decisions made during the
incident.Therefore, communities should have a say in how a
disaster response occurs.They should also shoulder responsibility for building their community’s resilience and enhancing its
recovery before, during, and after a disaster.The community may have capabilities and resources that do not exist in the volume
needed or at all within the traditi onal government response structure.There are many ways to leverage the commun ity’s capabilities and knowledge in the preparedness
process.Although often viewed as a challenge , engaging the community can be successfully
accomplished when approached correctly.The foundation for community-based pla nning is knowing the community (see Figure 4.2 ).A keen
understanding of the actual population and its needs will have a profound effect on the success or failure
of any plan.Understanding the requirements of tho se with access and functional needs affects mass care
courses of action and the resulting plans.Additionall y, the number of children in the community will
affect the ways in which schools are used as a resour ce, in turn defining some of the requirements for
reunification planning.Engaging the community will increase the likeli hood that people follow protective
action measures during a crisis because they unders tand how plans address household pets or service
animals.Likewise, taking into account the perceptions and fears of some populations, such as
undocumented immigrants, may incr ease the plan’s effectiveness.4-5

-based organizations in the planning process.They  may serve as an important resource for validating
assumptions about public needs, capabilities, and reactions.

Because many planning assumptions and
response activities will directly impact the public at  large, involving the whole community during the
planning phase is essential.This involvement s hould continue during valida tion and implementation.Potential roles include support to planning teams, public outreach, and establishing Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT).Planners can obt ain assistance for including the whole community
in the planning process from state or local Citi zen Corps Councils, as well as the Local Emergency
Planning Committee (LEPC).Pre-established partnerships and relationships are important for leveraging subject matter expertise and resources during a disaster.4.The Planning Process
Step 2: Understand the Situation
Effective risk management depends on a consistent comparison of the hazards a particular jurisdiction
faces.This is typically performed through a threa t/hazard identification and risk assessment process that
collects information about threats and hazards and assi gns values to risk for the purposes of determining
priorities, developing or comparing courses of action,  and informing decision making.Depending on the
resources available and leadership, a jurisdic tion could conduct an in-depth process—cataloging
everything from specific asset vulne rabilities to emergency personnel sta ffing levels.Often, however, this
level of analysis is not possible or practical; in such cases, jurisdictions should conduct a risk assessment
of achievable and appropriate scale and scope.Identify Threats and Hazards
Planners should start the problem-solving process by conducting research and analysis on the
jurisdiction’s threats and hazards.Considering the poten tial risks a jurisdiction may face brings specificity
to the planning process.If risks are problems and operational plans are the solution, then hazard and
threat identification and analysis are key steps in the planning process.The first step of research focuses on gathering inform ation about the jurisdiction’s planning framework,
potential risks, resource base, demographics, household pet and service animal population, and
geographic characteristics that could affect emergency operations.There are many existing resources available to support planners in this step.Threat assessments prepared for or  by agencies may provide informa tion on potential “soft targets” and
threats within the jurisdiction.In addition, jurisdictions’ hazard mitigation plans are an excellent resource
for this step, as they are required to identify, catalog,  and analyze all natural hazards that have the ability
to impact the specified community.

.In addition, jurisdictions’ hazard mitigation plans are an excellent resource
for this step, as they are required to identify, catalog,  and analyze all natural hazards that have the ability
to impact the specified community.

Jurisdictions s hould take additional steps to include human-caused
and technological hazards.Federal and state analyses that include data about historical incidents faced by the community also
provide valuable information for this step.In addition, local organizations (e.g., the local chapter of the
American Red Cross), utilities, other businesses, and me mbers of the planning team can provide records
about their experiences.As an additional source, planning teams can use stat e and local fusion centers to provide analytical
products, such as risk and trend analyses, that are de rived from the systematic collection and evaluation of
threat information.Fusion centers also provide access to national-level intelligence and can serve as a
mechanism to “deconflict” information.Sources for expertise on hazard or threat potential include jurisdictional agencies; academic, industrial,
and public interest group researchers; private consulta nts specializing in hazard or threat analysis; and
professional associations concerned with the hazards or  threats on a planner’s list.Sources of information
on the community and possible consequences from risks vary.To determine the potential consequences of
certain facility-based hazards, planners might check with the facility owner/operator or the agency (Federal, state, territorial, tribal, local, or regional) that regulates that kind of facility.The LEPC may be
able to assist with this information.For demogra phics, census data are available, as are off-the-shelf
computer products that organize such data by zip code.Knowing the number an d type of household pets
and service animals the jurisdiction may need to accommodate during an emergency situation will also
guide preparedness activities.Sources of such data include market statistics, household pet licensing
databases, and rabies vaccination records.4-7
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
The planning team should also make extensive use of the existing information about the jurisdiction.For
example, the local planning and zoning commission or  department may have extensive demographic, land
use, building stock, and similar data.Building inspection offices maintain  data on the structural integrity
of buildings, codes in effect at time of construction, and the hazard effects that a code addresses.Local public works (or civil engineering) departments and utilities are sources for information on potential damage to and restoration time for the critical infr astructures threatened by hazard effects.

 works (or civil engineering) departments and utilities are sources for information on potential damage to and restoration time for the critical infr astructures threatened by hazard effects.

The chamber
of commerce may offer a perspective on damage to  businesses and general economic loss.Other sources
of information mentioned previously—emergency service logs and reports, universities, professional associations, etc.—also apply.Understanding the consequences of a potential incident requires gathering information about the potential access and functional needs of residents within the community.To begin planning, jurisdictions must have an accurate assessment—an informed estimat e of the number and types of individuals with
disabilities and others with access and functional need s residing in the community.Emergency planners
should base their assessments on lists and information collected from multiple relevant sources, such as:
• U.S. Census data • Utility providers
• Social services listings (e.g., dialysis centers, Meals on Wheels) • Congregate settings (e.g., nursing homes, summer camps)
• Paratransit providers • Schools and universities
• Bureau of motor vehicles (accessible parking permit holders) • Medicaid
• Centers for Independent Living • Hospitals
• Home health agencies • Daycare centers (for children or senior citizens)
• Vocational rehabilitation and job access services • Places of worship
• Disability services providers • Homeless shelters
• Health or behavioral health agencies • Housing programs.If planners compile the numbers from various lists, often referred to as the “list of lists” concept, they will
have an estimate of the number of individuals resi ding in their communities, which will benefit planning
for sufficient transportation and sheltering.Togeth er, these lists can provide raw numbers vital to
understanding the magnitude of the community’s requi rements.Emergency managers should also gather
as much information as possible regarding the types of services these individuals require so emergency
staff can be adequately trained and resource needs can be met.These different types of assessments are sometimes mistak enly considered the same as registries when, in
fact, they are different.A registry is a database of individuals who voluntarily sign up and meet the
eligibility requirements for receiving emergency respon se services based on a need (the criteria for which
should be established by the jurisdiction).The next step of the threat and hazard identification process is to organize the information into a format
that is usable by the planning team.

 by the planning team.

One effective me thod for organizing hazard or threat information is to
use a matrix based on dimensions used  during the risk analysis process:
• Probability or frequency of occurrence
• Magnitude (the physical force associated with the hazard or threat)
4-8
4.The Planning Process
  4-9
• Intensity/severity (the impact or damage expected)
• Time available to warn
• Location of the incident (an area of interest or  a specific or indeterminate site or facility)
• Potential size of the affected area
• Speed of onset (how fast the hazard or threat can impact the public)
• Duration (how long the hazard or threat will be active)
• Cascading effects.Depending on the kinds of decisions and analyses the in formation is meant to support, planners might use
other categories for data organization.For example, the decision that one hazard poses a greater threat than another may require only a qualitative estimate (e.g., high versus medium), whereas planning how to
deal with health and medical needs caused by a par ticular hazard may require estimates of likely fatalities
and injuries.Assess Risk
The risk assessment
7 is the basis for EOP development.The
assessment helps a planning team decide what hazards or threats
merit special attention, what ac tions must be planned for, and
what resources are likely to be needed.The analysis method inventories, evaluates, and provides loss estimates for assets deemed critical during the response and recovery phases of an
incident.Planners can also obtain the Hazards U.S. Multi-Hazard
(HAZUS-MH) model from FEMA.HAZUS-MH is a nationally applicable and standardized methodology and software program that estimates potential losses from earthquakes, floods, and hurricane winds.This type of hazard assessment is similar to that which is required for hazard mitigation plans.In fact, if the
community possesses a FEMA-approved multi-hazard mitigation plan, an assessment may be readily
available.Mitigation plans can be used as referenc e documents to simplify the development of most
hazards-based analyses.The information gathered during the jurisdictional assessment of individuals with disabilities and others
with access and functional needs requires a detailed an alysis.Emergency planners need to review the
assessment findings and analyze the quantity and types of resources (including personnel) needed during
different types of incidents.

assessment findings and analyze the quantity and types of resources (including personnel) needed during
different types of incidents.

For example, a ju risdiction with a large number of limited English
proficiency residents might need to identify methods by which language assist ance will be provided (e.g.,
bilingual personnel, interpreters, translated documents) to support operati ons, such as evacuation,
sheltering, and recovery.Additionally, planners need to work with social services agencies to plan for
unaccompanied minors and to assess for types of resour ces needed for the community’s children during
and following a disaster.Hazard and threat analysis requires that the planning  team knows risks that have occurred or could occur
in the jurisdiction.The process should begin with a list  of the risks that concern planners, developed from
research conducted earlier in the planning process.A list of concerns might include those listed in Table
4.1.7 FEMA Publication 386-2, Understanding Your Risks: Identifying Hazards and Estimating Losses, provides a detailed method for
conducting hazard and risk assess ments for many hazards.Remember that as the situation is
analyzed and hazards or threats are
prioritized, each carries with it training, equipment, and exercise requirements.It is not too early—even
if only at a high level—to consider
what is within the scope of capability of the jurisdiction and how those capabilities can be enhanced through
preparedness activities and by the
adding or sharing of resources.Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101

or release of lethal chemical, biological, or radiological material.Using a risk analysis, the planning team must compare and prioritize risks to determine which hazardthreats merit special attention in planning (and other emergency and homeland security management
efforts).The team must consider the frequency of the hazard or threat and the likelihood or severity
potential of its consequences in order to develop a sing le indicator of the risk to the jurisdiction.This
effort allows for comparisons and the setting of priori ties.While a mathematical approach is possible, i
may be easier to manipulate qualitative ratings (e.g., hi gh, medium, low) or index numbers (e.g., reducing
quantitative information to a 1-to-3, 1-to-5, or 1-to-10 scale based on defined th resholds) for different
categories of information used in the ranking scheme.Some approaches involve the consideration of only
two categories—frequency and consequences—and treat th em as equally important.In other approach
potential consequences receive more weight than frequency.While it is important to have a sense of themagnitude involved (whether in regard to the single indicator used to rank hazards or to estimate the numbers of people affected), these indicators acHAZMAT toxicity and transportation routes.

itude involved (whether in regard to the single indicator used to rank hazards or to estimate the numbers of people affected), these indicators acHAZMAT toxicity and transportation routes.

The analysis process produces facts and assumpti ons, which can be distinguished as follows:
4.The Planning Process
• Assumptions consist of information accepted by planne rs as being true in the absence of facts in order
to provide a framework or establish expected cond itions of an operational environment so that
planning can proceed.Assumptions are used as facts onl y if they are considered valid (or likely to be
true) and are necessary for solving the problem.Incident managers replace assumptions with facts when they implement a plan.For example, when
producing a flood annex, planners may assume the loca tion of the water overflow, size of the flood hazard
area, and speed of the rise in water.When the plan is put into effect as the incident unfolds, operations
personnel replace assumptions with the facts of the s ituation and modify the plan accordingly.Planners
should use assumptions sparingly and put great effort into performing research and acquiring facts, including the use of historical precedent.The outcomes of the analysis process help planners determine goals and objectives (Step 3) and select the supporting planning concept they will use when developing the plan (Step 4).Step 3: Determine Goals and Objectives
Determine Operational Priorities
Operational priorities  specify what the responding organizations are to accomplish to achieve a desired
end-state for the operation.The senior official may communicate desired end-states for the operations
addressed in the plans.By using information from th e risk profile developed as part of the analysis
process, the planning team engages the senior official to establish how the hazard or threat would evolve in the jurisdiction and what defines a successful outcome for responders, disaster survivors, and the
community.Starting with a given intensity for the hazard or thr eat, the team imagines an incident’s development from
prevention and protection efforts, through initial warning (if available) to its impact on the jurisdiction (as
identified through analysis) and its generation of sp ecific consequences (e.g., collapsed buildings, loss of
critical services or infrastructure, death, injury, displacement).These scenarios should be realistic and
created on the basis of the jurisdictio n’s hazard/threat and risk data.Planners may use the incidents that
have the greatest impact on the jurisdiction (worst-case), those that are most likely to occur, or an incident
constructed from the impacts of a variety of risks.

 risk data.Planners may use the incidents that
have the greatest impact on the jurisdiction (worst-case), those that are most likely to occur, or an incident
constructed from the impacts of a variety of risks.

During this process of building an incident scenario,
the planning team identifies the requirements that determine actions and resources.Planners are looking
for requirements generated by the hazard or threat , the response, and by constraints/restraints.• Requirements can be caused by the nature of the hazard or threat.They lead to functions, such as law enforcement intervention, public protection, p opulation warning, and search and rescue.Response
requirements are caused by actions taken in response to an agent-generated problem.These tend to be common to all operations.An example is the potentia l need for emergency refueling during a large-
scale evacuation.Subsets could include  the needs to find a site for refueling, identify a fuel supplier,
identify a fuel pumping method, control traffic, and collect stalled vehicles.• A constraint is something that must be done (“must  do”), while a restraint is something that prohibits
action (“must not do”).They may be caused by a law, regulation, or management directive; some physical characteristic (e.g., terrain and road netw orks that make east-west evacuations impossible);
or resource limitations.Once the requirements are identified, the planning team restates them as priorities and affirms those priorities with the senior official.4-11
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Set Goals and Objectives Example: Relationships among the
Mission, Operational Priorities,
Goals, and Objectives
Plan Mission: Effectively coordinate
and direct available resources to protect the public and property from
hazards or threats.Operational Priority:  Protect the
public from hurricane weather and storm surge.Goal:  Complete evac uation before
arrival of tropical storm winds.Desired result: All self- and assisted
evacuees are safely outside of the
expected impact area prior to impact.Objective: Complete tourist
evacuation 72 hours before arrival of
tropical storm winds.Desired result: tourist segment of
public protected prior to hazard onset, allowing resources to be redirected to
accomplishing other objectives in
support of this goal or other goals.Goals and objectives must be carefully crafted to ensure they
support accomplishing the plan miss ion and operational priorities.They must also clearly indicate th e desired result or end-state they
are designed to yield.

support accomplishing the plan miss ion and operational priorities.They must also clearly indicate th e desired result or end-state they
are designed to yield.

This appro ach enables unity of effort and
consistency of purpose among the multiple groups and activities involved in executing the plan.Goals  are broad, general statements that indicate the intended
solution to problems identified by planners during the previous step.They are what personnel and equipment resources are supposed to achieve.They help identify when major elements of the response are complete and when the operation is successful.Objectives  are more specific and identifiable actions carried out
during the operation.They lead to achieving response goals and
determining the actions that par ticipants in the operation must
accomplish.Translating these objectives into activities, implementing procedures, or ope rating procedures by responsible
organizations is part of planning.As goals and objectives are set, planners may identify more requirements that will feed into the development of courses of action as well as the capability estimate (see Step 4).Step 4: Plan Development
Develop and Analyze Courses of Action
This step is a process of generating, comparing, a nd selecting possible solutions for achieving the goals
and objectives identified in Step 3.Planners consid er the requirements, goals, and objectives to develop
several response alternatives.The art and science of  planning helps determine how many solutions or
alternatives to consider; however, at least two options should always be considered.Developing only one
solution may speed the planning process, but it will probably provide for an inadequate response, leading
to more damaging effects on the affected population or environment.Developing courses of action uses the hybrid planning approach previously discussed.When developing
courses of actions, planners depict how an operation unfolds by building a portrait of the incident’s actions, decision points, and participant activities.Th is process helps planners identify tasks that occur
immediately at incident initiation, tasks that are more mid-incident focused, and tasks that affect long-term operations.The planning team should work thro ugh this process by using tools that help members
visualize operational flow, such as a white board, “sticky note” chart (see Figure 4.3 ), or some type of
project management or special planning software.4-12
4.

The Planning Process
Figure 4.3: “Sticky Note” Chart
Course of action development follows these steps: Courses of Action in a Nutshell
Courses of action address the what/
who/when/where/why/how for each solution.As each potential course of action is
identified, the planner should consider where it supports the priorities, goals, and objectives established by the
senior official.Additionally, the course
of action should be examined to determine whether it is feasible and whether the stakeholders that are
needed to implement it find it
acceptable.• Establish the timeline .Planners should cover all mission
areas in the timeline and typically use the speed of incident
onset to establish the timeline.The timeline may also change by phases.For example, a hu rricane’s speed of onset is
typically days, while a major HAZMAT incident’s speed of onset is minutes.The timeline for a hurricane might be in
hours and days, particularly during the pre- and post-impact
phases.The timeline for the HAZMAT incident would most likely be in minutes and hours.For a multijurisdictional or layered plan, the timeline for a particular scenario is the same at all participating levels of government.Placement of
decision points and response actions on the timeline depicts how soon the different entities enter the plan.• Depict the scenario .Planners use the scenario information
developed in Step 3 and place the incident information on the timeline.• Identify and depict decision points .Decision points indicate the place in time, as incidents unfold,
when leaders anticipate making decisions about a course of action.They indicate where and when
decisions are required to provide the best chance of achieving an intermediate objective or response
  4-13

goal (the desired end-state).They also help planners  determine how much time is available or needed
to complete a sequence of actions.•Identify and depict operational tasks .For each operational task depicted, some basic information is
needed.Developing this information helps planners incorporate the task into the plan when they are
writing it.Planners correctly identify an operati onal task when they can answer the following
questions about it:
–What is the action?–Who is responsible for the action?–When should the action take place?

 onal task when they can answer the following
questions about it:
–What is the action?–Who is responsible for the action?–When should the action take place?

–How long should the action take and how much time is actually available?–What has to happen before?–What happens after?–What resources does the person/entity need to perform the action?•Select courses of action.Once the above analysis is complete, planners must compare the costs and
benefits of each proposed course of action agains t the mission, goals, and objectives.Based on this
comparison, planners then select the preferred c ourses of action to move forward in the planning
process.While not necessary for every c ourse of action identified, planners should use their best
judgment and identify when the selection of a course or courses of action will need to be elevated to
the senior elected or appointed official for approval.Where practical, the appropriate official should
approve these actions prior to the review and completion of the plan.“Red-Teaming” as a Method for Analyzing Courses of Action
A “peer review” process for plans is a useful tool fo r examining whether plans contain all of the necessary
elements.Leveraging expertise from outsi de the jurisdiction will aid in challenging assumptions and identifying
gaps in the jurisdiction’s courses of action.For plans dealing with adaptive threat s (e.g., terrorism), examining plans “t hrough the eyes of the adversary” can
lead to significant improvements and a higher probabilit y of success.This process is known as “red-teaming.”
Essential elements of a red-team review include:
Engaging the law enforcement community and fusion centers to act as the adversary
Understanding the operational enviro
nment (e.g., geography, demography, economy, culture)
Establishing
a potential adversary’s identity, resources, tactics, and possible courses of action
Evaluating the plan under multiple scenarios and a wide range of circumstances using tabletop exercises,
facilitated semi
nars, and computer models and simulations to aid in analysis.Red teams should foster a culture of critical thinking , intellectualism, and self-criticism.Red team members
should be creative, objective, intellectually curious, and able to manage their egos.Red teams must act with
ingenuity and enthusiasm to develop and apply customiz ed approaches to every problem.

, intellectually curious, and able to manage their egos.Red teams must act with
ingenuity and enthusiasm to develop and apply customiz ed approaches to every problem.

Red teams need to
cultivate expertise, recognize the limitat ions of their own knowledge, constantly seek and evaluate new insights,
and have access to the opinions and understanding of tr uly informed experts.Finally, red teams need to avoid
being confrontational.Red team members need to work closely and solicit information from the staff; however, it
is best if they conduct their work in the background to  avoid interference from staff members who may have a
vested interested in a particular course of action.Red-teaming is most successful when senior officials endorse and support it.Participants must be able to make
their comments in an atmosphere of c onfidentiality and non-attribution.4-14
4.The Planning Process
  4-15 Identify Resources
Once courses of action are selected, the planning t eam identifies resources needed to accomplish tasks
without regard to resource availability.The object is to identify the resources needed to make the
operation work.Once the planning team identifies all the requirements, they begin matching available
resources to requirements.By tracking obligations  and assignments, the planning team determines
resource shortfalls and develops a list of needs that pr ivate suppliers or other jurisdictions might fill.The
resource base should also include a list of facilities vital to emergency operations, and the list should
indicate how individual hazards might affect the facilities.Whenever possible, planners should match
resources with other geographical/regional needs so that multiple demands for the same or similar
resources can be identified and conflicts resolved.This  step provides planners an opportunity to identify
resource shortfalls to pass to higher levels of government and to prepare pre-scripted resource requests, as appropriate.The EOP should account for unsolvable r esource shortfalls so they are not just “assumed
away.” The capability estimate process is critical to this effort.A capability estimate is a planner’s assessment of a ju risdiction’s ability to take a course of action.Capability estimates help planners decide if pursuing a particular course of action is realistic and
supportable.They help planners better project and understand what might take  place during an operation.Simply stated, the capability estimate represents the ca pabilities and resource types needed to complete a
set of courses of action.The resulting capability estimate will feed into the resource section of the plan or
annex.

 and resource types needed to complete a
set of courses of action.The resulting capability estimate will feed into the resource section of the plan or
annex.

Capability estimates may be written doc uments, tables or matrices, or oral presentations.The information
provided in a capability estimate should be able to answ er most questions about a jurisdiction’s ability to
support a given course of action.Planners can u se capability estimates for both future and current
operational planning.At a minimum, planners should prepare separate capability estimates for personnel,
administration and finance, operati onal organizations (e.g., fire, law enforcement, EMS), logistics,
communications, equipment, and facilities.Each capab ility estimate compares the courses of action being
considered for a particular operation.They make  recommendations as to which course of action best
supports the operation.Capability estimates should also identify the criteria used to evaluate each area;
facts and assumptions that affect those areas; and the issues, differences, and risks associated with a
course of action.Figure 4.4  provides a suggested format for a capability estimate.Figure 4.4: Suggested Capab ility Estimate Format
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Resource identification is particul arly important for supporting
children; individuals with disabilities, access, and functional
needs; and household pets and service animals .These
individuals will require a range of communication,
transportation, sheltering, human service, medical, and other resources throughout the life of an incident.Examples include, but are not limited to, durable medical equipment, oxygen, paratransit vehicles, accessible shelters, personal assistance services, and sign language interpreters.Identifying these requirements and the resources for mee ting them ahead of time will help planners fully
support individuals with disabilities and ot hers with access and functional needs.When identifying resources, the needs
of children are often forgotten, including diapers, formula and food appropriate for all ages, portable cribs/
playpens and the capability to
supervise unaccompanied children.Identify Information and Intelligence Needs
Another outcome from course of action development is a “list” of the information and intelligence needs
for each of the response participants.Planners shoul d identify the information and intelligence they will
need and their deadline(s) for receiving it to driv e decisions and trigger critical actions.These needs
eventually find their way into pl an information collection matrices.

v e decisions and trigger critical actions.These needs
eventually find their way into pl an information collection matrices.

When developing courses of action, the process should be periodically “frozen” so the planning team can:
• Identify progress made toward the end-state, including goals and objectives met and new needs or
demands
• Identify “single point failures” (i.e., tasks that, if  not completed, would cause the operation to fall
apart)
• Check for omissions or gaps
• Check for inconsistencies in organizational relationships
• Check for mismatches between the jurisdiction’s plan  and plans from other jurisdictions with which
they are interacting.Step 5: Plan Preparati on, Review, and Approval
Write the Plan
This step turns the results of course of action devel opment into an EOP.The planning team develops a
rough draft of the basic plan, functional annexes, hazard-specific annexes, or other parts of the plan as
appropriate.The recorded results from Step 4 provide an  outline for the rough draft.As the planning team
works through successive drafts, the members add necessary tables, charts, and other graphics.The planning team prepares and circulates a final draft to obtain the comments of organizations that have
responsibilities for implementing the plan.(See Chapter 3 for more information on plan formats.)Following these simple rules for writing plans and procedures will help ensure that readers and users understand their content:
• Keep the language simple and clear by writing in  plain English.Summarize important information
with checklists and visual aids, such as maps and flowcharts.• Avoid using jargon and minimize the use of acronyms.• Use short sentences and the active voice.Qualifie rs and vague wording onl y add to confusion.• Provide enough detail to convey an easily understood plan that is actionable.The amount of detail a
plan should provide depends on the target audience and the amount of certainty about the situation.4-16
4.The Planning Process
• Format the plan and present its contents so that its readers can quickly find solutions and options.Focus on providing mission guidance and not on discussing policy and regulations.Plans should
provide guidance for carrying out common tasks, as well as enough insight into intent and vision so that responders can handle unexpected events.Ho wever, when writing a plan, “stay out of the
weeds.” Procedural documents (e.g., SOPs /SOGs) should provide the fine details.

 responders can handle unexpected events.Ho wever, when writing a plan, “stay out of the
weeds.” Procedural documents (e.g., SOPs /SOGs) should provide the fine details.

• Ensure accessibility by developing tool s and documents (e.g., print, electronic, video) so they can be
easily converted to alternate formats.Review the Plan
Planners should check the written plan for its confor mity to applicable regulatory requirements and the
standards of Federal or state agencies, as appropriate , and for its usefulness in practice.Planners should
consult the next level of government about its plan review cycle.Reviews of plans allow other agencies
with emergency or homeland security responsibilities to suggest improvements to a plan on the basis of
their accumulated experience.For example, states may review local plans, and, upon request, FEMA
regional offices may assist states in the review of EO Ps.Hazard-specific Federal programs, such as the
Radiological Emergency Preparedness Program, require periodic review of certain sections of the all-
hazards plan and may require review of associated SOPs/SOGs.Commonly used criteria can help decision makers de termine the effectiveness and efficiency of plans.These measures include adequacy, feasibility, and acceptability.Decision makers directly involved in planning can employ these criteria, along with their understanding of plan requirements, not only to determine a plan’s effectiveness and efficiency but al so to assess risks and define costs.Some types of
analysis, such as a determination of acceptability, are largely intuitive.In this case, decision makers apply
their experience, judgment, intuition, situational aw areness, and discretion.Other analyses, such as a
determination of feasibility, should be rigorous and standardized to minimize subjectivity and preclude
oversights.• Adequacy .A plan is adequate if the scope and concept of planned operations identify and address
critical tasks effectively; the plan can accomplish the assigned mission while complying with
guidance; and the plan’s assumptions are valid, reasonable, and comply with guidance.• Feasibility .A plan is feasible if the organization can accomplish the assigned mission and critical
tasks by using available resources within the time contemplated by the plan.The organization
allocates available resources to tasks and tracks th e resources by status (e.g., assigned, out of service).Available resources include internal assets and tho se available through mutual aid or through existing
state, regional, or Federal assistance agreements.• Acceptability .

 tho se available through mutual aid or through existing
state, regional, or Federal assistance agreements.• Acceptability .

A plan is acceptable if it meets the requirements driven by a threat or incident, meets
decision maker and public cost and time limitations, a nd is consistent with the law.The plan can be
justified in terms of the cost of resources and if its scale is proportional to mission requirements.Planners use both acceptability and feasibility tests to ensure that the mission can be accomplished
with available resources, without incurring excessive  risk regarding personnel,  equipment, material,
or time.They also verify that risk management procedures have identified, assessed, and applied control measures to mitigate operational risk (i.e ., the risk associated with achieving operational
objectives).• Completeness .A plan is complete if it:
– Incorporates all tasks to be accomplished
– Includes all required capabilities
  4-17
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
4-18
– Integrates the needs of the general population, children of all ages, individuals with disabilities
and others with access and functional needs, im migrants, individuals with limited English
proficiency, and diverse racial and ethnic populations
– Provides a complete picture of the sequence a nd scope of the planned response operation (i.e.,
what should happen, when, and at whose direction)
– Makes time estimates for achieving objectives
– Identifies success criteria and a desired end-state.• Compliance .The plan should comply with guidance and doctrine to the maximum extent possible,
because these provide a baseline that facilitates both planning and execution.When using these five criteria, planners should ask the following questions:
• Did an action, a process, a decision, or the operationa l timing identified in the plan make the situation
worse or better?• Were new alternate courses of action identified?• Were the requirements of childre n, individuals with disabilities, others with access and functional
needs, immigrants, individuals with limited Eng lish proficiency, and diverse racial and ethnic
populations fully addressed and integrated into all appropriate aspects of the plan?• What aspects of the action, process, decision, or ope rational timing make it something to keep in the
plan?• What aspects of the action, process, decision, or operational timing make it something to avoid or
remove from the plan?• What specific changes to plans and procedures, pe rsonnel, organizational structures, leadership or
management processes, facilities, or equi pment can improve ope rational performance?

 or
remove from the plan?• What specific changes to plans and procedures, pe rsonnel, organizational structures, leadership or
management processes, facilities, or equi pment can improve ope rational performance?

Additionally, when reviewing the plan, a jurisdiction does not have to provide all of the resources needed
to meet a capability requirement established during the planning effort.However, the plan should explain
where the jurisdiction will obtain the resources to su pport those required capabilities.For example, many
jurisdictions do not have the bomb s quads or urban search and rescue  teams required to meet certain
capabilities.Neighboring jurisdictions can provide those resources (or capability elements) through
MAAs, MOAs, MOUs, regional compacts, or some other formal request process.When conducting this review, the checklist in Appendix C will provide a useful benchmark to ensure all
planning elements are addressed.In particular, those el ements related to planning for children, individuals
with access and functional needs, and those with hous ehold pets and service animals are critical to each
component of the planning process.When planning for these groups, consider the following questions,
while being mindful of specific concerns for immigran t, racial/ethnic communities, and individuals with
limited English proficiency:

sectors, including populations with diverse languages and culture, populat ions with economic challenges,
populations that depend on public tran sportation, and nonresident visitors.Approve and Disseminate the Plan
Once the plan has been validated, th e planner should present the plan to the appropriate elected officials
and obtain official promulgation of the plan.The promulgation process should be based in a specific
statute, law, or ordinance.Obtaining the senior official’s approval through a formal promulgation documentation process is vital to gaining the widest ac ceptance possible for the plan.It is also important
to establish the authority required for changes and modifications to the plan.Once the senior official grants approval, the planner s hould arrange to distribute the plan and maintain a
record of the people and organizati ons that received a copy (or copies)  of the plan.“Sunshine” laws may
require that a copy of the plan be posted on the juri sdiction’s website or be placed in some other public
accessible location.The plan should be available in  alternate formats, upon request, to maintain
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.Step 6: Plan Implementation and Maintenance
Training
After developing a plan, it must be disseminated and managers must be require d to train their personnel
so they have the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to perform the tasks identified in the plan.Personnel should also be trained on the organization-specific procedures necessary to support those plan
tasks.

so they have the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to perform the tasks identified in the plan.Personnel should also be trained on the organization-specific procedures necessary to support those plan
tasks.

Exercise the Plan
Evaluating the effectiveness of plans involves a combin ation of training events, exercises, and real-world
incidents to determine whether the goals, objectives, decisions, actions, and timing outlined in the plan
led to a successful response.In this way, homeland security and other emergency preparedness exercise
programs become an integral part of the planning proc ess.Similarly, planners need to be aware of lessons
and practices from other communities.The Less ons Learned Information Sharing website
  4-25
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
4-26   (http://www.llis.dhs.gov) provides an excellent forum for evaluating concepts identif ied in a jurisdiction’s
plan against the experiences of others.A remedial action process  can help a planning team identify,
illuminate, and correct problems with the jurisdiction’s EOP.This
process captures information from exercises, post-disaster critiques, self-assessments, audits, administrative reviews, or lessons-learned processes that may indicate that deficiencies exist.Members of the planning team should reconvene to discuss the problem and to
consider and assign responsibility for generating remedies across all
mission areas.Remedial actions may involve revising planning assumptions and operational concepts, changing organizational tasks,
or modifying organizational implementing instructions (i.e., the SOPs/SOGs).Remedial actions may also involve providing refresher
training for an organization’s personnel.“Living” Plans
Plans must not be placed on a shelf to collect dust!Whenever possible, training and exercise must be conducted for each plan to ensure that current
and new personnel are familiar
with the priorities, goals, objectives and courses of action.Plan maintenance is also critical
to the continue d utility of the
plans an organization has developed.A number of
operations have had setbacks
due to old information, ineffective procedures, incorrect role
assignments, and outdated laws.Further, the priorities for a jurisdiction may change over time as the makeup of the included
communities change, as
resources expand or contract, and as capabilities evolve.Routinely Review Your Plans!The final component of a remedial action process is a mechanism for tracking and following up on the assigned actions.

!The final component of a remedial action process is a mechanism for tracking and following up on the assigned actions.

As appropriate, significant issues and problems identified through a remedial action
process and/or the annual review should provide the information
needed to allow the planning team to make the necessary revision(s)
to the plan.Review, Revise, and Maintain the Plan
This step closes the loop in the pl anning process.It focuses on adding
the information gained by exercising the plan to the research collected
in Step 2 and starting the planning cycle over again.Remember,
planning is a continuous process that does not stop when the plan is published.Plans should evolve as lessons are learned, new information and insights are obtained, and priorities are updated.Planning teams should establish a process for review ing and revising the plan.Reviews should be a
recurring activity.Some jurisdictions have found it us eful to review and revise portions of their EOPs
every month.Many accomplish their reviews on an annua l basis.In no case should any part of the plan go
for more than two years without being reviewed and revised.Teams should also  consider reviewing and
updating the plan after the following events:
• A major incident
• A change in operational resources (e.g., policy, personnel, organizational structures, management
processes, facilities, equipment)
• A formal update of planning guidance or standards
• A change in elected officials
• Each activation
• Major exercises
• A change in the jurisdiction’s demogr aphics or hazard or threat profile
• A change in the acceptability of various risks
• The enactment of new or amended laws or ordinances.Appendix A:  Authorities and

Appendix B: List of Acronyms and Glossary
Community
Community has more than one definition.Each use depends on the context:
• A political or geographical entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce laws and ordinances for
the area under its jurisdiction.In most cases, the comm unity is an incorporated town, city, township,
village, or unincorporated area of a county.Howeve r, each state defines its own political subdivisions
and forms of government.• A group of individuals (community of interest) who ha ve a religion, a lifestyle, activity interests, an
interest in volunteer organiza tions, or other characteristics in common.These communities may
belong to more than one geographic commun ity.Examples include: faith-based and social
organizations; nongovernmental a nd volunteer organizations; private service providers; critical
infrastructure operators; and local and regional corporations.Consequence

property, and status of key facilities and services (e.g., hospitals and other health care facilities, fire and police stations, communications networks, water and sanitation systems, utilities, transportation
networks) resulting from a human-caused or natural disaster.

Disability
According to the Americans with Disabilities Act, the term “individual with a disability” refers to “a
person who has a physical or mental impairment that s ubstantially limits one or more major life activities,
a person who has a history or record of such an im pairment, or a person who is regarded by others as
having such an impairment.” The term “disability” h as the same meaning as that  used in the Americans
with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008, P.L.1 10-325, as incorporated into the Americans with
Disabilities Act.See http://www.ada.gov/pubs/ada.htm for the definition and specific changes to the text
of the Americans with Disabilities Act.State laws and local ordina nces may also include individuals
outside the Federal definition.Disaster
An occurrence of a natural catastrophe, technological acci dent, or human-caused incident that has resulted
in severe property damage, deaths, and/or multiple injuri es.As used in this Guide, a “large-scale disaster”
is one that exceeds the response cap ability of the local jurisdiction and requires state, and potentially
Federal, involvement.As used in the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act
(Stafford Act), a “major disaster” is “any natural catastrophe [...] or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood,
or explosion, in any part of the United States, whic h in the determination of the President causes damage
of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant ma jor disaster assistance under [the] Act to supplement
the efforts and available resources of states, local governments, and disaster relief organizations in
alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering cau sed thereby” (Stafford Act, Sec.102(2), 42 U.S.C.5122(2)).B-3
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Earthquake
The sudden motion or trembling of the ground produced by abrupt displacement of rock masses, usually
within the upper 10 to 20 miles of the earth’s surface.Emergency
Any incident, whether natural or human-caused, that re quires responsive action to protect life or property.

, whether natural or human-caused, that re quires responsive action to protect life or property.

Under the Stafford Act, an emergency “means any occasi on or instance for which, in the determination of
the President, Federal assistance is needed to supplement state and local efforts and capabilities to save
lives and to protect property and public health and safet y, or to lessen or avert the threat of a catastrophe
in any part of the United States” (Stafford Act, Sec.102(1), 42 U.S.C.5122(1)).Emergency Assistance
According to the National Response Framework, emergency assistance is “[a]ssistance required by
individuals, families, and their communities to ensure that immediate needs beyond the scope of the traditional ‘mass care’ services provided at the local level are addressed.These services include: support to evacuations (including registration and tracking of evacuees); reunification of families; provision of aid
and services to special needs populations; evacuati on, sheltering, and other emergency services for
household pets and services animals; support to specialized shelters; support to medical shelters; nonconventional shelter management; coordination of donated good s and services; and coordination of
voluntary agency assistance.”
Emergency Medical Services
Services, including personnel, fac ilities, and equipment, required to ensure proper medical care for the
sick and injured from the time of injury to th e time of final disposition (which includes medical
disposition within a hospital, temporary medical facili ty, or special care facility; release from the site; or
being declared dead).Further, emergency medi cal services specifically includes those services
immediately required to ensure proper medical care a nd specialized treatment for patients in a hospital
and coordination of related hospital services.Emergency Operations Center
The physical location at which the coordination of information and resources to support incident
management (on-scene operations) activities normally ta kes place.An Emergency Operations Center may
be a temporary facility or may be located in a more central or permanently established facility, perhaps at
a higher level of organization within a jurisdiction.Emergency Operations Centers may be organized by
major functional disciplines (e.g., fire, law enforcement,  medical services), by jurisdiction (e.g., Federal,
state, tribal, regional, city, county), or by some combination thereof.Emergency Operations Plan
The ongoing plan maintained by various jurisdictional levels for responding to a wide variety of potential
hazards.

state, tribal, regional, city, county), or by some combination thereof.Emergency Operations Plan
The ongoing plan maintained by various jurisdictional levels for responding to a wide variety of potential
hazards.

out specific actions; identifies the personnel, equipment,  facilities, supplies, and other resources available;
and outlines how all actions  will be coordinated.Emergency Support Function
Used by the Federal Government and many stat e governments as the primary mechanism at the
operational level to organize and provide assistance.Emergency Suppor t Functions align categories of
resources and provide strategic objectives for their u se.Emergency Support Functions use standardized

resource management concepts such as typing, inve ntorying, and tracking to facilitate the dispatch,
deployment, and recovery of resources be fore, during, and after an incident.Evacuation
The organized, phased, and supervised withdrawal, disp ersal, or removal of civilians from dangerous or
potentially dangerous areas, and their reception and care in safe areas.• A spontaneous evacuation occurs when residents or citizens in the threatened areas observe an
incident or receive unofficial word of an actual or perceived threat and, without receiving instructions
to do so, elect to evacuate the area.Their movement , means, and direction of travel are unorganized
and unsupervised.• A voluntary evacuation  is a warning to persons within a designated area that a threat to life and
property exists or is likely to exist in the immediate future.Individuals issued this type of warning or order are not required  to evacuate; however, it would be to their advantage to do so.• A mandatory or directed evacuation  is a warning to persons within the designated area that an
imminent threat to life and property exists and individuals must  evacuate in accordance with the
instructions of local officials.Evacuees
All persons removed or moving from areas threatened or struck by a disaster.Federal Coordinating Officer
The official appointed by the President to execute Stafford Act authorities, including the commitment of
FEMA resources and mission assignments of other Federal departments or agencies.In all cases, the
Federal Coordinating Officer represents the FEMA Ad ministrator in the field to discharge all FEMA
responsibilities for the response and recovery efforts underway.

For Stafford Act incidents, the Federal
Coordinating Officer is the primary Federal representa tive with whom the State Coordinating Officer and
other response officials interface to determine the most  urgent needs and to set objectives for an effective
response in collaboration with the Unified Coordination Group.Flood
A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from
overflow of inland or tidal wate rs, unusual or rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters, or
mudslides/mudflows caused by accumulation of water.Governor’s Authorized Representative

on behalf of the state, including certification of ap plications for public assistance; (2) represent the
Governor of the impacted state in the Unified Coordination Group, when required; (3) coordinate and
supervise the state disaster assistance program to in clude serving as its grant administrator; and (4)
identify, in coordination with the State Coordinatin g Officer, the state’s critical information needs for
incorporation into a list of Essential Elements of Information.Hazard
A natural, technological, or human-caused source or cause of harm or difficulty.B-5
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
Hazardous Material
Any substance or material that, wh en involved in an accident and re leased in sufficient quantities, poses a
risk to people’s health, safety, and/or property .These substances and materials include explosives,
radioactive materials, flammable liquids or solids,  combustible liquids or solids, poisons, oxidizers,
toxins, and corrosive materials.Household Pet
According to FEMA Disaster Assistance Policy 9253.19 , “[a] domesticated animal, such as a dog, cat,
bird, rabbit, rodent, or turtle, that  is traditionally kept in the home fo r pleasure rather than for commercial
purposes, can travel in commercial carriers, and be ho used in temporary facilities.Household pets do not
include reptiles (except turtles), amphibians, fish, in sects/arachnids, farm animals (including horses), and
animals kept for racing purposes.” This definition is used by FEMA to determine assistance that FEMA
will reimburse and is the definition used in the produc tion of this Guide.

health and medical emergencies, other occu rrences requiring an emergency response).Incident Command System A standardized on-scene emergency management construc t specifically designed to provide an integrated
organizational structure that reflects the complexity and demands of single or multiple incidents, without
being hindered by jurisdictional boundaries.The In cident Command System is the combination of
facilities, equipment, personnel, procedures, and communications operating within a common
organizational structure and designed to aid in the management of resources during incidents.It is used
for all kinds of emergencies and is  applicable to small, as well as large and complex, incidents.The
Incident Command System is used by various juri sdictions and functional agencies, both public and
private, to organize field-level incident management operations.Incident Management Assistance Team
A national-based or regional-based team composed of SMEs and incident management professionals,
usually composed of personnel from multiple Federal departments and agencies, which provide incident
management support during a major incident.Joint Field Office
The primary Federal incident management field struct ure.The Joint Field Office is a temporary Federal
facility that provides a central location for the coordination of Federal, state, territorial, tribal, and local
governments and private sector and nongovernmental  organizations with primary responsibility for
response and recovery.The Joint Field Office structur e is organized, staffed, and managed in a manner
consistent with National Incident Management System  principles and is led by the Unified Coordination

Although the Joint Field Office uses an Incide nt Command System structure, the Joint Field
Office does not manage on-scene operations.Instead, the Joint Field Office focuses on providing support
to on-scene efforts and conducting broader support opera tions that may extend beyond the incident site.Joint Information Center
A facility established to coordinate a ll incident-related public information activities.It is the central point
of contact for all news media.Public information o fficials from all participating agencies should co-locate
at the Joint Information Center.Jurisdiction
Jurisdiction has more than one definition.Each use depends on the context:
• A range or sphere of authority.Public agencies have jurisdiction at an incident related to their legal
responsibilities and authority.Jurisdictional authority at an incident can be political or geographical
(e.g., city, county, tribal, state, or Federal boundary lines) or functional (e.g., law enforcement, public health).• A political subdivision (e.g., Federal, state, count y, parish, municipality) with the responsibility for
ensuring public safety, health, and welfare within its legal authorities and geographic boundaries.Likelihood
Estimate of the potential for an incident’s occurrence.Limited English Proficiency
Persons who do not speak English as their primary la nguage and who have a limited ability to read, speak,
write, or understand English.Mass Care
The actions that are taken to protect evacuees  and other disaster victims from the effects of the disaster.Activities include mass evacuation, mass sheltering, mass feeding, access and functional needs support,
and household pet and service animal coordination.Mitigation
Activities providing a critical foundation in the effort to reduce the loss of life and property from natural
and/or human-caused disasters by avoiding or lessening the impact of a disaster and providing value to
the public by creating safer communities.Mitigation seeks to fix the cycle of disaster damage, reconstruction, and repeated damage.These activities or actions, in most cases, will have a long-term
sustained effect.

National Incident Management System
A set of principles that provides a systematic, proactive approach guiding government agencies at all
levels, nongovernmental organizations , and the private sector to work seamlessly to prevent, protect
against, respond to, recover from, and mitigate the effects of incidents, regardless of cause, size, location, or complexity, in order to reduce the loss of life or property and harm to the environment.National Response Framework
This document establishes a comprehens ive, national, all-hazards approach  to domestic incident response.It serves as a guide to enable responders at all le vels of government and beyond to provide a unified

U.S. jurisdictions plan and respond.Nongovernmental Organization
An entity with an association that is based on the interest s of its members, individuals, or institutions.It is
not created by a government, but it may work cooperativ ely with government.Such organizations serve a
public purpose and are not for private benefit.Examples of nongovernmental organizations include faith-
based charity organizations and the American Red Cross.Planning Assumptions
Parameters that are expected and used as a context, basis, or requirement for the development of response
and recovery plans, processes, and procedures.If a planning assumption is not valid for a specific
incident’s circumstances, the plan may not be ade quate to ensure response success.Alternative methods
may be needed.For example, if a decontamination capability is based on the planning assumption that the facility is not within the zone of release, this assumption must be verified at the beginning of the response.Preparedness
Actions that involve a combination of planning, reso urces, training, exercising, and organizing to build,
sustain, and improve operational capabilities.Prepar edness is the process of identifying the personnel,
training, and equipment needed for a wide range of potential incidents, and developing jurisdiction-
specific plans for delivering capabiliti es when needed for an incident.Prevention
Actions to avoid an incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring.Prevention involves
actions to protect lives and property.

 incident or to intervene to stop an incident from occurring.Prevention involves
actions to protect lives and property.

It involves appl ying intelligence and other information to a range of
activities that may include such countermeasures as  deterrence operations; heightened inspections;
improved surveillance and security operations; investig ations to determine the full nature and source of
the threat; public health and agri cultural surveillance and testing processes; immunizations, isolation, or
quarantine; and, as appropriate, specific law enfo rcement operations aimed at deterring, preempting,
interdicting, or disrupting illegal ac tivity and apprehending potential perp etrators and bringing them to
justice.Protected Group
A group of people qualified for special protection by a law, policy, or similar authority.For example,
Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects against discrimination on the grounds of race, color, or
national origin.Protection
Actions to reduce or eliminate a threat to people, property, and the environment.Primarily focused on
adversarial incidents, the protection of critical infrastructure and key resources is vital to local
jurisdictions, national security, pub lic health and safety, and economic vitality.Protective actions may
occur before, during, or after an incident and prevent, minimize, or contain the impact of an incident.Recovery
The development, coordination, and execution of service and site restoration plans; the reconstitution of
government operations and services; individual, pr ivate sector, nongovernmental, and public assistance
programs to provide housing and to promote restor ation; long-term care and treatment of affected

Appendix C:  Emergency
Operations Plan Development
Guide
This appendix provides a pu ll-out guide that applies the planning process described in Chapter 4 and
provides content guidance for various elements of an emergency operations plan (EOP).It includes a list
of key planning elements that should be included in the basic plan and its annexes.It is not all-inclusive
or intended to prescribe any particular plan format, and it is not meant to indicate that all items are
appropriate to every level of government.Statutes may assign authority to perform various functions.A
brief reference should be made to these statutes in the plan where applicable.Steps in the Planning Process
Step 1: Form a Collaborative Planning Team.Planners must ensure that  operational planning not only
involves the jurisdiction’s entire emergency manageme nt and homeland security team, but also actively
engages the whole community in the planning pr ocess.Planning must also be community-based,
integrating the needs of the entire community.This includes addressing the critical planning requirements
of children, individuals with disabilities, others w ith access and functional needs, and individuals with
limited English proficiency.Using a team or group a pproach helps organizations define their perception
of the role they will play during an operation.Invol vement of the private sector is especially critical in
this process.Initially, the team should be small, cons isting of planners from the organizations that usually
participate in emergency or homeland security operati ons.They form the core for all planning efforts.Disasters begin and end locally.When the response is ove r, it is the local community that has to live with
the decisions made during the incident.Therefore, communities should have a say in how a disaster response occurs.They should also shoulder respons ibility for building their community’s resilience and
enhancing its recovery before, during, and after a disaster.The community can bring capabilities and
resources to an incident that may not exist in th e volume needed or at all within the traditional
government structure.Engaging the whole community as part of the planning team is critical for
resilience.Figure 4.2  provides methods for engaging the community in the planning process.Step 2: Understand the Situation.Planners should begin the problem-solving process by conducting
research and analysis on the jurisdiction’s threats, hazards, and resources.

 engaging the community in the planning process.Step 2: Understand the Situation.Planners should begin the problem-solving process by conducting
research and analysis on the jurisdiction’s threats, hazards, and resources.

Giving consideration to the
potential risks a jurisdiction may face brings specificity to the planning process.If risks are viewed as
problems and operational plans are the solution, then h azard and threat identification and analysis are key
steps in the planning process.The first step of research focuses on gathering inform ation about the jurisdiction’s planning framework,
potential risks, resource base, demographics, household pet and service animal population, and geographic characteristics that could affect emergency operations.There are many existing resources available to support planners in this step, incl uding threat assessments, mitigation plans, local
organizations (e.g., businesses, nongovernmental entities, utilities), Federal and state analyses that include
data about historical incidents, a nd registries for population demographics.C-1
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
The second step of the threat and hazard identification process is to organize the information into a format
that is usable by the planning team.One effective me thod for organizing hazard or threat information is to
use a matrix based on dimensions used during the ri sk analysis process, incl uding the (1) probability or
frequency of occurrence; (2) magnitude (i.e., the physical  force associated with the hazard or threat); (3)
intensity/severity (i.e., the impact or damage expect ed); (4) time available to warn; (5) location of the
incident (i.e., an area of interest or a specific or indeterminate site or facility); (6) potential size of the affected area; (7) speed of onset (i.e., how fast the hazard or threat can impact the public); (8) duration
(i.e., how long the hazard or threat will be active); and (9) cascading effects.The risk assessment is the basis for EOP development.The assessment helps a planning team decide what hazards or threats merit special attention, what actions  must be planned for, and what resources are likely
to be needed.In order to set planning priorities, the planning team must consider the frequency of the hazard or threat and the likelihood or potential severity of its consequences in order to develop a single
indicator of the risk to the jurisdiction.This can  be done using a mathematical approach, qualitative
ratings, or index numbers.

 risk to the jurisdiction.This can  be done using a mathematical approach, qualitative
ratings, or index numbers.

While a mathematical approach is possible, it may be easier to manipulate
qualitative ratings (e.g., high, medium, low) or index numbers (e.g., reducing quantitative information to a
1-to-3, 1-to-5, or 1-to-10 scale based on defined thres holds) for different categories of information used in
the ranking scheme.Some approaches involve the c onsideration of only two categories—frequency and
consequences—and treat them as equally important.In other approaches, potential consequences receive
more weight than frequency.While  it is important to have a sense of the magnitude involved (i.e.,
whether in regard to the single indicator used to  rank hazards or to estimate the numbers of people
affected), these indicators are static.Some hazards or threats may pose a limited risk to the community; therefore, additional analysis is not necessary.Step 3: Determine Goals and Objectives.Using information
from the hazard profile developed as part of the analysis process,
the planning team should think about how the hazard or threat would evolve in the jurisdiction and what defines a successful operation.During this process, the planning team identifies
requirements that determine actions and resources, including the
following: Example: Relationships among the
Mission, Operational Priorities,
Goals, and Objectives
Plan Mission: Effectively coordinate
and direct available resources to
protect the public and property from hazards or threats.Operational Priority:  Protect the
public from hurricane weather and storm surge.Goal:  Complete evac uation before
arrival of tropical storm winds.Desired result: all self- and assisted
evacuees are safely outside of the
expected impact area prior to impact.Objective: Complete tourist
evacuation 72 hours before arrival of
tropical storm winds.Desired result: tourist segment of
public protected prior to hazard onset,
allowing resources to be redirected to accomplishing other objectives in supportof this goal or other g oals.• Agent requirements are caused by the nature of the hazard or
threat.• Response requirements are caused by actions taken in response to an incident-generated problem.• Constraint/restraint demands are caused by things planners must do, are prohibited from doing,
and/or are not able to do.Once the planning team identifies requirements, they restate them as priorities, goals, and objectives.

 are caused by things planners must do, are prohibited from doing,
and/or are not able to do.Once the planning team identifies requirements, they restate them as priorities, goals, and objectives.

Priorities  indicate a desired
end-state for the operation.A critical source for these priorities is the vision and desired end-state co mmunicated by senior officials.Goals  are broad, general statements that indicate the intended
methods for achieving the mission and priorities, specifying desired results.Objectives  are more specific and identifiable
actions carried out during the operation.Clear definition of goals and objectives enables unity of effort and consistency of purpose
C-2
Appendix C: Emergency Operations Plan Development Guide
among the multiple groups and activities involved in executing the plan.Step 4: Plan Development.First, develop and analyze courses of action.This is a process of generating
and comparing possible solutions for achieving the goals and objectives identified in Step 3.Use a
process that combines aspects of scenario-based, functi onal, and capabilities-based planning.Depict how
the operation unfolds by using a visual process that  shows relationships among the incident’s actions,
decision points, and participant activities that allow th e planner to anticipate challenges.Typically, such a
process follows these steps:
• Establish the timeline .Planners typically use the speed of an incident’s onset to establish the
timeline.Placement of decision points and res ponse actions on the timeline depicts how soon the
different entities enter the plan.• Depict the scenario .Planners use the scenario information de veloped in Step 3 and place the incident
information on the timeline.• Identify and depict decision points .Decision points indicate the place in time, as incidents unfold,
when leaders anticipate making decisions about a course of action.They indicate where and when
decisions are required to provide the best chance of achieving an intermediate objective or response
goal (i.e., the desired end-state).They also help pl anners determine how much time is available or
needed to complete a sequence of actions.• Identify and depict operational tasks .For each operational task depicted, some basic information is
needed.– What is the action?– Who is responsible for the action?– When should the action take place?– How long should the action take and how much time is actually available?– What has to happen before?– What happens after?– What resources does the person/entity performing the action need?• Select courses of action.

 to happen before?– What happens after?– What resources does the person/entity performing the action need?• Select courses of action.

Planners must compare the costs and benefits of each proposed course of
action against the mission, goals, and objectives.Based on this comparison, planners then select the
preferred courses of action to move forward in th e planning process.To the extent possible and
appropriate, senior officials should approve course of action decisions during plan development.• Identify resources .Initially, the planning team identifies resources needed to accomplish operational
tasks in an unlimited manner.Once the planning team identifies all the requirements, they begin
matching available resources to requirements.The EOP should account for unsolvable resource
shortfalls so they are not just “assumed away.”
• Identify information needs .Planners identify a “list” of the information needs for each of the
response participants, including the time they need it, to drive decisions and trigger critical actions.• Assess progress .This process should be periodically “frozen” so the planning team can:
– Identify progress made toward the end-state
– Identify goals and objectives met and new needs or demands
– Identify “single point failures” (i.e., tasks that , if not completed, would cause the operation
to fall apart)
  C-3
Comprehensive Preparedness Guide 101
– Check for omissions or gaps
– Check for inconsistencies in organizational relationships.The planning team should work through this pro cess by using tools that help members visualize
operational flow, such as a white board, “sticky note” chart, or some type of project management or
planning software.Step 5: Plan Preparation, Review, and Approval.This step turns the results of the course of action
development performed in Step 4 into an EOP.Th e planning team develops a rough draft of the basic
plan or annexes.As the planning team works throu gh successive drafts, they add necessary tables, charts,
and other graphics.The team prepares a final draft a nd circulates it for comment to organizations that
have responsibilities for implementing the plan.The writte n plan should be checked for its conformity to
applicable regulatory requirements and the standards of  Federal or state agencies (as appropriate) and for
its usefulness in practice.Once validated, the planning team presents the plan to the appropriate officials for signature and promulgation.The promulgation process should be based on specific statute, law, or
ordinance.

 (as appropriate) and for
its usefulness in practice.Once validated, the planning team presents the plan to the appropriate officials for signature and promulgation.The promulgation process should be based on specific statute, law, or
ordinance.

Once approved, the planner should arrange to distribute the plan to stakeholders who have
roles in implementing the plan.Step 6: Plan Implementation and Maintenance.Evaluating the effectiveness of plans involves a
combination of training events, exercises, and real -world incidents to determine whether the goals,
objectives, decisions, actions, and timing outlined in  the plan led to a successful response.Commonly
used criteria can help decision makers determine the effectiveness and efficiency of plans.These
measures include adequacy, feasibility, acceptability, completeness, and compliance with guidance or
doctrine.When evaluating the plan, planners should ask the following questions:
• Did an action, process, decision, or the operational timing identified in the plan make the situation
worse or better?• Were new alternate courses of action identified?• Were the requirements of childre n, individuals with disabilities, and others with access and functional
needs fully addressed and integrated into  all appropriate aspects of the plan?• What aspects of the action, process, decision, or ope rational timing make it something to keep in the
plan?• What aspects of the action, process, decision, or operational timing make it something to avoid or
remove from the plan?• What specific changes to plans and procedures, pe rsonnel, organizational structures, leadership or
management processes, facilities, or equi pment can improve ope rational performance?Planning teams should establish a recurring process for reviewing and revising the plan.For example, each component of the plan is reviewed and revised at a minimum of once every two years.Teams should also consider reviewing and updating the plan after the following events:
• A change in operational resources
• A formal update of planning guidance or standards
• A change in elected or appointed officials
• A plan activation or major exercise
C-4
Appendix C: Emergency Operations Plan Development Guide
• A change in the jurisdiction’s demogr aphics or hazard or threat profile
• The enactment of new or amended laws or ordinances.Figure 4.1  (page 4-1) depicts the process for planners to u se when moving through the planning steps.Basic Plan Content Guide

failure, human mistake), result from an emergency caused by another hazard (e.g., flood, storm), or are caused intentionally.Hazardous Materials
This section of the annex should address the hazard-specific procedures and methods used to prepare for
and respond to releases that involve HAZMAT that is manufactured, stored, or used at fixed facilities or
in transport (if not addressed in a functional annex, such as ESF #10).This section may include materials
that exhibit incendiary or explosive properties when released.Note: Some states have laws that require
each Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) to develop a Chemical Emergency Preparedness and Response Plan on this topic.Some states have laws  requiring the local emergency management agency to
incorporate the LEPC’s plan into the emergency management agency’s planning and preparedness
activities.Specific planning criteria established by a State Emergency Response Commission must be
reviewed and addressed in order to develop the LEPC plan.• For LEPCs that complete a stand-alone plan, describe how the jurisdiction coordinates that plan with
the EOP.• For LEPC plans that are part of the EOP, describe how the planning team used and adhered to the
State Emergency Response Commission criteria in orde r to be in compliance with those requirements
and the EOP requirements discussed previously.C-29

C-30   Lethal Chemical Agents and Munitions
This section of the annex should identify and describ e the jurisdiction’s specifi c concerns, capabilities,
training, agencies, and resources used to mitigate agai nst, prepare for, respond to, and recover from lethal
chemical agent and munitions incidents (e.g., sarin, mustard, and VX).Include a hazard analysis summary
that discusses where/how chemical agent inci dents are likely to impact the community.Radiological Incidents This section of the annex should address the hazard- specific methods to prepare for and respond to
releases that involve radiological materials that  are at licensed facilities or in transport.• Describe/identify the jurisdiction’s specific concerns, capabilities, training, agencies, and resources
that will be used to mitigate against, prepare fo r, respond to, and recover from radiological hazards.

Why talk about a Disaster Supplies Kit?After a disaste r, local officials and relief workers will be on the scen e, but
they cannot reach everyone immediatel y.You could get help in hours, or it
may take days.Basic services, such as electricit y, gas, wate r, and tele-
phones, may be cut off, or you may have to evacuate at a moment ’s notice.You probably won ’t have time to shop or search for the supplies you’ll
need.Your family will cope best by
preparing for disaster before it strikes.What is a Disaster Supplies Kit?Assembling the supplies you mightneed following a disaster is an impor-tant part of your Family Disaster Plan.Following a disaste r, having extra sup-
plies at home or supplies to take with
you in the event of an evacuation can help your family endure evacuationor home confinement.Learn more about Disaster Supplies Kits by contact-ing your local emergency management agency or American Red Cross

In addition to your Disaster Supplies Kit basics and Evacuation Supplies Kit,gathering the following items will help your family endure home confine-ment, which often happens following disasters and may include the loss of utilities.• Wrench to turn off household gas and wate r. Keep it near the shut-off
valves.• A week ’s supply of food and wate r.
• Additional blankets and sleeping bags.Also, consider using a N OAA Weather Radio with the tone-alert feature
in your home.N OAA Weather Radio is the best means for receiving warn-
ings from the National Weather Service.The National Weather Service con-
tinuously broadcasts updated weather warnings and forecasts that can bereceived by N OAA Weather Radios sold in many stores.N OAA Weather
Radio now broadcasts warning and postevent information for all types ofhazards — both natural (such as earthquakes and volcanic activity) andtechnological (such as chemical releases or oil spills).Working with other
federal agencies and the Federal Communications Commission ’s new
Emergency Alert System, N OAA Weather Radio is an “all hazards” radio
network, making it the single source for the most comprehensive weatherand emergency information available to the public.Your National Weather
Service recommends purchasing a radio that has both a battery backup and a Specific Area Message Encoder (SAME) featur e, which automatically
alerts you when a watch or warning is issued for your count y, giving you
immediate information about a life-threatening situation.The averagerange is 40 miles, depending on topography; the National Weather Radio
signal is a line-of-sight signal, which does not bore through hills or mountains.Water
Having an ample supply of clean water is a top priority in an emergenc y.• Store water in plastic containers, su ch as soft drink plastic bo t-
tles.Seal containers tightl y, label them and store in a cool, dark place.Replace water every six months.Avoid using containers that will
decompose or break, such as milk cartons or glass bottles.

eal containers tightl y, label them and store in a cool, dark place.Replace water every six months.Avoid using containers that will
decompose or break, such as milk cartons or glass bottles.

• Keep at least a th ree-day supply of water, or a minimum of
three gallons per person .It is strongly recommended to have more
if possible.Use one-half gallon per day for drinking, and one-half gallonfor cooking and sanitation.A normally active person needs to drink atleast two quarts of water each da y.Hot e nvironments and intense phys-
ical activity can double that amount.Children, nursing mothers, and illpeople will need more.Store your three-day supply in a handy place.You need to have water packed and ready in case there is no time to
fill water bottles when disaster strikes.• Water needs to be t reated only if it is of questionable purit y.
n Boiling is the safest method of treating wate r. Strain water through a
clean cloth to rem ove bulk impurities.Bring water to a rolling boil
for about one full minut e, keeping in mind that some water will
evaporate.Let the water cool before drinking.Boiled water will tastebetter if you put oxygen back into it by pouring the water back andforth between two clean containers.This will also impr ove the taste
of stored wate r.
n You can use household liquid bleach to kill microorganisms.Use
only regular household liquid bleach that contains 5.25 percent sodi-um hypochlorite.Do not use scented bleaches, color-safe bleaches,or bleaches with added cleaners.Add 16 drops of bleach per gallonof wate r, stir, and let stand for 30 minutes.If the water does not
have a slight bleach odo r, repeat the dosage and let stand another
15 minutes.If it still does not smell of chlorin e, discard it and find
another source of wate r. Other chemicals, such as iodine or water
treatment products sold in camping or surplus stores that do notcontain 5.25 percent hypochlorite as the only active ingredient, arenot recommended and should not be used.n Distillation i nvolves boiling water and then collecting the vapor that
condenses back to wate r. The condensed vapor will not include salt
or other solid impurities.

 solid impurities.

To distill, fill a pot halfway with wate r. Tie a
cup to the handle on the pot ’s lid so that the cup will hang rightside
up when the lid is upside down (make sure the cup is not touchingthe water) and boil the water for 20 minutes.The water that dripsfrom the lid into the cup is distilled.• Melt ice cubes or use water f rom undamaged hot water tanks,
toilet tanks (not the b owl), and water pipes if you need addition-
al water.• If you need to find water outside of your home, you can use
rainwater; st reams, ri vers, and  other m oving bodies of water;
ponds and la kes; and natu ral springs.If you question its purity,

drink flood wate r.
Food
Even though it is unlikely that an emergency would cut off your food supply for two weeks, you should consider preparing a supply that will lastthat long.The easiest way to develop a two-week stockpile is to increasethe amount of basic foods you normally keep on your shelves.If your watersupply is limited, try to avoid foods that are high in fat and protein, anddon’t stock salty foods, since they will make you thirst y.Familiar foods can
lift morale and give a feeling of security in time of stress.Also, cannedfoods won ’t require cooking, wate r, or special preparation.Take into
account your family ’s unique needs and tastes.Try to include foods that
they will enjoy and that are also high in calories, protein, carbohydrates,vitamins, and minerals.• Pack at least a th ree-day supply of nonperishable food and
water, and sto re it in a han dy place.You need to have these items
packed and ready in case there is no time to gather food from thekitchen when disaster strikes.• Select foods that require no refrige ration, p reparation, or
cooking, and little or no water.

Introduction iiiInTroduCTIon
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) strives
continuously to improve the delivery of disaster assistance to State,
local, and tribal governments� One important goal of disaster assistance
is to reduce the vulnerability of communities to damage from future
disasters� This Wildfire Hazard Mitigation Handbook for Public Facilities
(Handbook) is intended to assist facility owners affected by wildfire
disasters by suggesting mitigation measures that can be taken to reduce
the vulnerability of damaged facilities to future wildfire incidents.The
measures described in this Handbook are applicable to the Public
Assistance (PA) Program and are intended to help Applicants for
assistance under the program identify options that can be implemented
during post-disaster repair and rebuilding to reduce the potential for
future damage �
FEMA provides assistance to State, local, and tribal governments under
the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency
Assistance Act (Stafford Act), 42 United States Code §§ 5121-5206,
as amended.Under the Stafford Act, FEMA is authorized to provide
resources necessary to reduce the loss of life and property caused by
emergencies and major disasters.


as amended.Under the Stafford Act, FEMA is authorized to provide
resources necessary to reduce the loss of life and property caused by
emergencies and major disasters.

FEMA works with Federal, State, local,
and tribal liaisons to carry out this mission through a comprehensive
emergency management program.FEMA provides funding and technical assistance to State, local, and
tribal governments for a range of disaster preparedness and mitigation
activities.The Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) grant program provides
funding to State, local, and tribal governments for mitigation planning
and implementation of cost-effective mitigation projects prior to a
disaster �
After the President declares a major disaster, FEMA incorporates
mitigation into recovery efforts through several mechanisms.Under
Section 406 of the Stafford Act, FEMA provides funding for repair and
rebuilding of disaster-damaged public facilities and those of certain
private, non-profit entities through the PA Program.As part of the
PA Program, FEMA may provide funding for cost-effective mitigation
measures undertaken in the course of repairing or rebuilding damaged
facilities, sometimes referred to as “406 Mitigation.” Section 404
of the Stafford Act also authorizes FEMA to provide funding to State,
local, and tribal governments through the Hazard Mitigation Grant
Program (HMGP), sometimes referred to as “404 Mitigation,” for the
implementation of long-term mitigation measures �
iv IntroductionThis Handbook focuses on mitigation that FEMA funds under the PA
Program following Presidentially declared disasters in which assistance
for the restoration of disaster-damaged facilities is authorized.The
Handbook can also be useful for evaluating the mitigation options
that are available to planners when developing long-term mitigation
strategies or when considering measures to be funded under the
HMGP, PDM Program, or other grant programs, even though these other
programs are not described in the Handbook �
The Problem
The cost of response and recovery has escalated to unprecedented
levels in recent years from the increased frequency and severity
of disasters � Between 1999 and 2008, FEMA spent an average of
$2.8  billion per year responding to major disasters.

Of that amount, an
average of $1 �2 billion was spent repairing or replacing public facilities,
which does not include response and recovery costs of other Federal
agencies; State, local, and tribal governments; and losses of individuals
and businesses� For more information, see www �fema�gov/government/
grant/pa/stat2�sht m�
The Solution
The most effective way to reduce excessive loss is through disaster
preparedness and mitigation � To best achieve this goal, FEMA
encourages the vigorous pursuit of the following objectives �
objective 1: Break the disaster-rebuild-disaster cycle.Until recently,
this cycle was the most common mode of disaster recovery.Repairing
substandard facilities to their pre-disaster condition does not protect
the community from future damage or reduce long-term costs.The
community should work to break this cycle through effective planning,
identification of measures that can reduce the potential for future
damage, and adoption of appropriate codes and standards for
construction �
objective 2: Strengthen facilities so that they are able to withstand
natural hazards more effectively.Cost-effective upgrades that reduce
the probability of future damage to vulnerable facilities and that can be
incorporated during rebuilding should be considered whenever possible �
objective 3: Ensure that communities address natural hazards as part
of comprehensive planning � Comprehensive plans should include the
community’s significant natural hazards and the goals and actions that
reduce the community’s vulnerability to these hazards.Introduction vThe r esult
Achieving these objectives will substantially enhance community
resilience and economic sustainability after a disaster, as shown in
Natural Hazard Mitigation Saves: An Independent Study to Assess
the Future Savings from Mitigation Activities , a study conducted by
the Multihazard Mitigation Council and funded by FEMA (Multihazard
Mitigation Council, 2005).The study indicates that hazard mitigation
saves an average of $4 for every $1 of investment.vi Purpose of the HandbookPurP oSe of The handbook
This Handbook is intended for use by State, local, tribal, and private, non-
profit Applicants for assistance, FEMA and State PA Group Supervisors,
and FEMA and State PA Program Project Specialists.

 assistance, FEMA and State PA Group Supervisors,
and FEMA and State PA Program Project Specialists.

The Handbook can
be used to identify potentially feasible mitigation measures that can be
implemented during the repair and rebuilding of damaged facilities after
a disaster �
The Handbook applies to public and private, non-profit facilities eligible
for funding under the PA Program and focuses on projects that are
commonly eligible for hazard mitigation funding under the program.Due
to the urgency in repairing damaged facilities after a disaster, long-term
mitigation opportunities are frequently not fully explored, and hazard
mitigation funding opportunities through the PA Program are often not
fully used.The Handbook can also be used as a resource for mitigation
measures that may be eligible for funding under other mitigation grant
programs, some of which are noted above �
The Handbook contains information about mitigation measures that
address the most common types of damage sustained in wildfires, that
have been shown to be successful, and that can be implemented in a
timely fashion.The Handbook is not a construction guide.Mitigation
measures are described conceptually, and installation details and
construction methods are not included �
Users of the Handbook are advised to refer to Disaster Assistance
Policy 9526.1, “Hazard Mitigation Funding Under Section 406 (Stafford
Act),” for FEMA policy governing funding for hazard mitigation under
the PA Program.The policy describes those circumstances under which

Public assistance Program eligibility
As with all agencies that provide Federal funding, FEMA has criteria that
must be met before proposed PA Program projects can be approved �
These criteria are based on the requirements of the Stafford Act, its
implementing regulations,1 and policies that FEMA has developed
to apply the PA Program to specific circumstances.Only FEMA can
determine the eligibility of an Applicant, facility, work, or cost under
the PA Program.Eligibility criteria are described in FEMA 322, Public
Assistance Guide  (FEMA, 2007) � Additional publications, PA Program
policies, and other information regarding the PA Program can be
obtained at www �fema�gov/government/grant/pa/index�sht m or from
the appropriate FEMA Regional Office.engineering, design, and Permitting r equirements
The Handbook does not list site-specific requirements because the
engineering analysis, design, and permitting requirements for each
project vary widely.However, the Handbook does provide some common
code and design issues to be considered when implementing mitigation
measures and references containing additional technical information�
Repair and mitigation of structural elements most often require a
professional engineer who can analyze the condition of the structure and
determine the appropriate repair and mitigation �
The mitigation measures described in this Handbook may not be
appropriate in areas where other hazards, such as earthquakes and
hurricanes are also a factor.Design factors related to non-wildfire
hazards should be evaluated when mitigation measures are considered.1 The PA Program regulations are published in Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations

environmental and historic Preservation Considerations
When providing funds under the PA Program, FEMA must consider
a range of Federal environmental and historic preservation laws,
regulations, and Executive Orders that apply to the use of Federal funds
and require the funding agency to ensure compliance prior to funding.The size and type of project, project site, and area conditions generally
determine the level of review for compliance that must be performed �
Environmental and historic preservation laws, regulations, and Executive
Orders that commonly apply to PA Program mitigation projects are
summarized in Appendix B.More information on FEMA’s environmental
and historic preservation compliance responsibilities is available in

Reviews for compliance with these laws, regulations, and Executive
Orders must be completed before FEMA can approve funding for PA
Program mitigation projects and before the projects are started because
the review may identify steps that need to be taken or conditions that

evaluating potential mitigation measures should coordinate with
the Regional Environmental Officer or designee for the appropriate
procedures necessary to support the compliance reviews.Mitigation k eywords

x Overview of the Public Assistance ProgramovervI ew of The PublIC aSSIST anCe PrograM
The PA Program is authorized by the Stafford Act.Under this
program, FEMA provides recovery assistance to State, local, and
tribal governments and certain private, non-profit entities following
Presidential declarations of emergencies and major disasters � The
program provides assistance for extraordinary costs for debris removal,
emergency protective measures, and permanent restoration of damaged
facilities� Under the program, which is based on reimbursement of actual
costs, the Federal government provides a minimum of 75 percent of
eligible costs �
The Stafford Act and its implementing regulations stipulate that funding
for permanent restoration of damaged facilities is limited to work that is
necessary to restore a facility to its pre-disaster design.The PA Program
may also provide funding for upgrades that are necessary to meet
current codes and standards and for hazard mitigation measures, as
described below �
For more information about the PA Program, see FEMA 322, Public
Assistance Guide  (FEMA, 2007), go to www �fema�gov/government/

FEMA Regional Office.upgrades necessary to Meet Current Codes and Standards
When a disaster-damaged facility must be repaired or replaced, PA
Program funding may be used to pay for upgrades that are necessary to
meet current codes and standards.This situation typically occurs when
older facilities, particularly buildings, must be repaired in accordance
with codes that were adopted after the original construction�
For the cost of an upgrade to be eligible, the code or standard requiring
the upgrade must:

Section 406 of the Stafford Act authorizes FEMA to provide funding for
hazard mitigation measures that go beyond the scope of work that is
eligible under the program.PA Program guidelines for the eligibility of
hazard mitigation measures are described in Disaster Assistance Policy
9526.1, “Hazard Mitigation Funding Under Section 406 (Stafford Act)”
(see Appendix  A)�
Users of this Handbook should note that the eligibility criteria for
mitigation measures under the PA Program are much different from the
criteria for funding mitigation measures under the HMGP, PDM Program,
and other mitigation programs� Applicants for PA Program funding
should consult with State and FEMA PA Program representatives when
considering mitigation measures for the restoration of disaster-damaged
facilities using PA Program funding� As stated above, the Handbook
should always be used in conjunction with Disaster Assistance Policy
9526.1 and with other guidance published by FEMA for the PA Program.xii Introduction to Wildfire DamageInTroduCTIon To wI ldfIre d aMage

A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that spreads through vegetative fuels.

dfIre d aMage
wildland/u rban Interface fire hazards
A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that spreads through vegetative fuels.

Vegetative fuels include those that are characteristic of wildlands,
such as trees, grasses, understory growth, and ground litter; and those
that are purchased at nurseries for home or community landscaping
purposes, including trees, mulch, grasses, and ornamental plants� In
addition to the presence of fuel, the occurrence and severity of wildfires
are governed by weather, such as high temperatures, low humidity,
high winds, and drought conditions; and topography (for example,
canyons and gulches act as chimneys, intensifying fires in certain areas).Different combinations of these factors contribute to the potential
severity of wildfires.In the wildland/urban interface, buildings and other human development
intermingle with vegetative fuels, exposing the development to
potential fire damage when wildfires occur.Other factors that affect the
vulnerability of development to wildfire are location, weather conditions
during the wildfire, and the fire-suppression capabilities of local
response agencies�
Increase in Wildfire Risk
The pressure to develop land over the past several decades has fueled
the expansion of the residential and commercial environment outward
from community centers and into the surrounding wildland.In the
western United States, nearly 40 percent of new home construction is
adjacent to or intermixed with wildland vegetation (Firewise Colorado,
2001)� Combined with an increase in fuel loads due to construction
and changes in vegetation, this trend has resulted in greater exposure
of development to the occurrence of wildfire.The result is a significant
increase in the risk of damage to development from wildfire.This risk is also increased by the trend towards larger wildfires.According
to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the number of
fires in the United States has declined every year since the early 1980s,
but the number of acres burned has increased steadily every year since
the mid-1990s � In terms of number of acres burned, six of the ten worst
fire seasons on record have occurred since 2000.Introduction to Wildfire Damage  xiiioccurrence of wildland/u rban Interface fires
Wildland/urban interface fires are a threat across the United States.According to the National Interagency Fire Center, wildfires occurred in
every state in 2006, burning over 9 million acres.

 Fire Center, wildfires occurred in
every state in 2006, burning over 9 million acres.

Major fires in the wildland/urban interface have the potential for vast
destruction by destroying homes and other structures, causing mass
evacuations, and causing injuries and deaths � Notable recent examples
are:
East Bay Hills, Oakland, California, 1991: This fire burned 1,600 acres •
and resulted in 25  fatalities, the destruction of 3,300 single-family
homes and 450 apartment units, and damages of $1 �5 billion �
Florida Wildfires, 1998: This fire burned 500,000 acres and resulted •
in evacuations of 35,000 residents, closure of an interstate highway,
and damage or destruction of 337 homes�
Rodeo-Chediski Fire, Arizona, 2002: This fire burned over 462,000 •
acres, making it one of the largest fires in state history, and destroyed
426 homes�
Southern California Wildfires, 2003: These fires, which burned •
750,000 acres in six counties around Los Angeles and San Diego,
destroyed 3,700 homes and resulted in 29 fatalities.Southern California Wildfires, 2007: Striking the same region as the •
2003 wildfires, the 2007 fires burned over 500,000 acres, destroyed
1,700 homes, and displaced over 900,000 people, the largest
evacuation in California history.Wildfire Damage to Public Facilities1
Wildfires propagate by consuming available fuel, including vegetation
and combustible materials.In an approaching wildfire, facility
components that are combustible can be ignited by embers, firebrands,
flames, radiant energy, and convective energy, as described below.Burning embers and firebrands, carried on air currents, can travel •
significant distances in advance of a wildfire and land on a facility,
igniting exterior materials, or enter the facility through an opening,
igniting interior materials�
1 As stated above, public facilities and facilities owned by certain private, non-
profit entities are eligible for funding under the PA Program.For purposes of this
Handbook, references to “public facilities” include any facilities eligible for funding
under the PA Program, including private, non-profit facilities.xiv Introduction to Wildfire DamageFlames from the combustion of nearby materials can transfer to a •
facility and cause ignition of facility components.

 Introduction to Wildfire DamageFlames from the combustion of nearby materials can transfer to a •
facility and cause ignition of facility components.

Radiant energy from combustion of nearby materials can be sufficient •
to cause ignition of facility components, even if the components are
not on the exterior of the facility.Convective energy, in the form of hot gases, removes moisture from •
the air, penetrates openings, and can be sufficient to cause ignition of
facility components.A wildfire can deform or melt facility components that do not initially
ignite.Damage to power systems can cause surges that damage
electrical and mechanical equipment�
Facilities that are particularly vulnerable to wildfire damage include
those that have the following characteristics:1
Combustible construction materials or materials that deform or melt •
when heated
Combustible exterior components or attached structures•
Openings such as vents, that allow heat, embers, or firebrands to •
enter the facility and ignite combustible components within the facility
Features such as overhangs that allow heat, gases, embers, and •
firebrands to be trapped adjacent to combustible materials
Features such as gutters, decks, and fences that allow combustible •
debris to accumulate, providing fuel adjacent to the facility that can
ignite, resulting in ignition of facility components
Interior components that can ignite when the facility exterior is heated•
Although the facility design and construction materials may contribute to
vulnerability to wildfire, the presence, type, and density of vegetation has
a significant impact on the level of risk to the facility.Vegetative fuels can
lead surface fires to the facility and produce embers and firebrands that
can cause ignition when striking or entering the facility.Additionally, leaf
litter, needles, and other vegetative matter that accumulate in or near
a facility can ignite and spread fire to the facility.Although measures to
reduce or eliminate vegetative fuels may not be eligible for PA Program
funding, these measures are critical to reducing the vulnerability of a
facility to a wildfire and the cost of the measures can be minimal.1 The order in which these characteristics are presented is not related to their
importance.The vulnerability of a specific facility is based on many factors,
including topography and available local fire suppression capabilities.Introduction to Wildfire Damage  xvWildfire Code Requirements and Standards
State and local officials have sought to reduce the vulnerability to wildfire
by developing code requirements and standards for construction in
areas where wildfires pose a risk.

 xvWildfire Code Requirements and Standards
State and local officials have sought to reduce the vulnerability to wildfire
by developing code requirements and standards for construction in
areas where wildfires pose a risk.

The codes and standards have been
developed over time to expand fire protection beyond traditional fire
codes that address interior structure fires to include measures to protect
structures from the exterior threat posed by wildfires.At the national level, the International Code Council has prepared
the International Wildland Urban Interface Code (IWUIC), which
supplements the International Building Code that has been adopted by
many States.The model code regulations included in the IWUIC bring
together requirements for planning and design for buildings constructed
or modified within wildland/urban interface areas.Other nationally
applicable standards, such as the National Fire Protection Association
(NFPA) Fire Protection Infrastructure for Land Development, NFPA 1141
(NFPA, 2008a) and Standards for Reducing Structure Ignition from
Wildfire, NFPA 1144 (NFPA, 2008b), provide similar guidance.Because the presence of vegetation that could fuel a wildfire is the
greatest threat to life, health and safety, and buildings and other
facilities, requirements for fuel reduction and the creation of defensible
space  have often been the focus of codes and standards for reducing
vulnerability to wildfires.These requirements are intended to reduce the
rate of fire spread and provide a safer environment for fire suppression.The requirements are focused on the removal of vegetation, such as
trees, brush, and grasses, to create firebreaks immediately adjacent to
buildings and other structures, and reduced fuel zones that disrupt the
horizontal and vertical continuity of combustible vegetation.Defensible
space is described in Appendix D of this Handbook.Additionally, codes and standards have been developed for planning,
zoning, and land development components that are designed to
reduce vulnerability to wildfires.The codes and standards may include
requirements to avoid areas of increased risk, such as canyons that can
accelerate the rate of fire spread; requirements for building separation;
specifications for streets and driveways to allow ingress/egress; and
specifications for water supply.The protection of individual facilities is guided by codes that have
incorporated ignition-resistant construction standards , which include
requirements designed to reduce the potential for ignition, particularly
due to flying embers and firebrands, in areas prone to wildfire hazards.

bers and firebrands, in areas prone to wildfire hazards.

xvi Introduction to Wildfire DamageIgnition-resistant construction standards  are based on the use of fire-
resistant materials, noncombustible materials , and 1-hour fire-rated
assemblies�
Designating an area as a fire severity zone is based on factors such as
fuel, topography, and weather.The designation includes the potential
severity of wildfire that could occur (for example, extreme, high, or
moderate wildfire severity).The assessment and mapping of fire severity
zones and dissemination of information about the areas provide an
additional tool for planning and designing facilities and development to
reduce vulnerability to wildfires.Many State and local governments use
fire severity zones to set standards for ignition-resistant construction
that vary depending on wildfire severity.The IWUIC provides for three
classes of ignition-resistant construction based on the severity of the fire
hazard in the area in which the building is located.Accordingly, the fact
that a facility is located in a fire severity zone may guide the selection of
mitigation measures�
Elements of Successful Wildfire Mitigation
A comprehensive effort to reduce the vulnerability of public facilities to
wildfires incorporates the following elements:
Definition of the fire severity zone to determine the potential fire •
severity at the location of the facility.Establishment of • defensible space  around the facility to keep
wildfires away from the facility and allow for fire suppression activities.Modification to, or incorporation of, components that reduce the •
potential for ignition in the event that a wildfire approaches the facility.The last element may be eligible for PA Program funding during
restoration of a damaged public facility if required for repair of damaged
elements under current codes and standards or if it is a cost-effective
hazard mitigation measure.

Components that reduce the potential for
ignition, which are the focus of this Handbook, should include:
Noncombustible components that resist ignition•
Fire-resistant assemblies to reduce the spread of heat and flames•
Components that prevent the trapping and intrusion of hot gases, •
embers, and firebrands that could cause ignition

Buildings 1I.buIldIngS
In this section, mitigation measures that can reduce the vulnerability of
buildings and attached structures such as decks and ramps to wildfire
hazards are described.One measure that is not included and may not
be eligible for PA Program funding, creation of defensible space  around
the building, may be critical to reducing the vulnerability of the building
to wildfire hazards.

Information about creating a defensible space is
provided in Appendix D.
Typical damage to buildings:  In general, the factors that make a
building vulnerable to wildfire damage are:
Proximity to topographic features such as steep slopes, ridges, and •
saddles, which can contribute to the spread of wildfire; high wind
condition s increase the risk
Proximity to fuels including vegetation, other materials, structures, •
and accumulated debris, and lack of defensible space
Building components that do not consist of•  fire-resistant  or
noncombustible materials but are exposed to radiant heat, hot
gases, flames, embers, or firebrands that may cause ignition of the
components
Openings through which hot gases, embers, and firebrands can •
intrude and cause ignition within the building
A reduction in the vulnerability of a building to wildfire damage is most
effectively achieved through measures that address all of these factors.Although the type and design of public buildings vary widely, building
components that are most susceptible to damage during wildfires are
common to many building types.These components are described
below �
roofs: Roofs are the most vulnerable component of the building.They
can be exposed to flames and, due to their horizontal orientation, are
especially susceptible to ignition by airborne embers and firebrands.Combustible debris may accumulate on the roof or in gutters.Aside from
creating a defensible space, installing a Class A rated roof is the most
critical element in reducing a building’s vulnerability to wildfire.exterior walls: Exterior walls that are not constructed to ignition-
resistant construction standards are vulnerable to ignition due to
flames, radiant heat, and airborne embers and firebrands.Combustible
materials within the wall may ignite due to conduction of heat from
2 Buildingsexterior materials.Openings for utilities and other purposes may allow
hot gases and embers to intrude, causing ignition within the building�
vents: These components may ignite if not constructed of  fire-resistant
or noncombustible material or may allow hot gases and embers to
intrude, causing ignition within the building�
Exterior doors, windows, and skylights: Door, window, and skylight
assemblies may ignite if not constructed to ignition-resistant
construction standards .


intrude, causing ignition within the building�
Exterior doors, windows, and skylights: Door, window, and skylight
assemblies may ignite if not constructed to ignition-resistant
construction standards .

Additionally, gaps around doors and breakage
of glass in doors, windows, and skylights may allow hot gases, embers,
and firebrands to intrude, causing ignition within the building.Ramps, decks, and other attached structures:  These structures are
often constructed of combustible materials that provide fuel for flames
that can spread to the building.Additionally, hot gases and embers may
ignite vegetation or materials stored beneath these structures, causing
them to ignite �
foundations: Foundations may be constructed of combustible materials
that can ignite.Additionally, hot gases and embers may penetrate the
foundation through vents and windows and ignite material stored in
crawl spaces�
Contents: Building contents are often combustible and once ignited,
can contribute to the spread of fire through the interior of the building.equipment: Equipment such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
equipment may be damaged by heat or flames or may allow hot gases
and embers to enter the building through gaps where the equipment
penetrates the building exterior �

Introduction: Roofs may be steep-sloped (roofs with a slope greater

components of the roof assembly, with examples of these types of roofs,
are listed below.

 a slope greater
than 3:12) or low-sloped (low-sloped roofs include flat roofs).The
components of the roof assembly, with examples of these types of roofs,
are listed below.

Roof assemblies have a fire-resistance rating  based on their resistance
to external fire exposures.The American Society of Testing and Materials
International (ASTM) classifies roof assemblies as Class A (highest rating), B, or C using test method E108.Assemblies that fail the test (do not meet Class A, B, or C criteria) are unrated.A Class A rated roof
assembly is recommended when considering mitigation options.A roof assembly includes all of the interacting roof components such
as the roof covering and roof deck.Installing a noncombustible  roof
covering or deck alone is not necessarily sufficient for the roof assembly
to achieve a Class A rating.Under 406 Mitigation, mitigation can be
applied only to the damaged element.However, when determining the material to repair or replace the damaged element, the entire roof assembly should be considered to achieve a Class A rating.For example, a roof with a fire-retardant-treated  wood shingle roof covering can reach
a Class A rating only if coupled with a specific cap sheet underlayment .Causes of Damage: The roof is the most critical component of the
building’s vulnerability.

Exterior Walls 19b.exterior w alls
Introduction:  The design and composition of exterior walls, and
consequently their vulnerability to wildfire damage, vary depending on
the type of building.T• he exterior of wood-frame and steel-stud buildings consists of
exterior wall cladding (such as brick, stone, stucco, wood siding,
wood shingles, or vinyl siding) that is placed over sheathing (such as
plywood, Oriented Stand Board, particle board, or gypsum board).Buildings with solid load-bearing walls may be constructed of brick, •
stone, or concrete block �
Steel frame and concrete frame buildings may incorporate a wide •
range of materials for exterior walls depending on their design,
including metal panels; glazing; fiberglass or cementitious panels;
in-fill brick, concrete, or hollow clay tile masonry; and pre-cast or cast-
in-place concrete panels �
The exterior of tilt-up buildings consists of pre-cast concrete panels�•
Causes of damage: In general, exterior walls with combustible cladding
are the most vulnerable to wildfire damage.Cladding composed of
combustible materials, such as wood siding, may ignite when exposed
to flames, radiant heat, or airborne embers and firebrands.Once the
cladding ignites, fire may burn through the cladding to the sheathing or
interior, spread vertically to the eaves and roof, or transmit heat to the
interior.Vinyl cladding may deform, exposing the underlying sheathing or
interior directly to flames and heat.Laps in siding represent weak points where flames can quickly burn
through to the sheathing or interior.

Additionally, openings for wall
penetrations (such as for utilities), may allow heat, hot gases, and
embers to intrude, causing ignition of combustible materials in the
building interior �

44 Windows and SkylightsF.Windows and Skylights
Introduction:  During a wildfire, windows and skylights are often the
weakest part of the building due to their susceptibility to failure.If a
window or skylight fails, the wildfire has a direct access point into the
building interior �
Causes of damage:  Windows and skylights commonly fail during
wildfires when the glazing breaks.Window or skylight glazing can break
due to a differential between indoor and outdoor temperatures during a
wildfire.The heat differential stresses the glazing and eventually causes
cracking�
During a wildfire, glazing can also become dislodged and fall out of
place.For example, vinyl frames warp and then melt until the window
fails� Firebrands can be blown with enough force to break window and
skylight glazing.Radiant heat can also pass through unbroken windows
and skylights and ignite combustible materials inside a building.Mitigation measures for common wildfire damage

52 Foundationsg.f oundations
Introduction:  Foundations vary widely based on building type and
design.Many types of foundations, such as concrete slab-on-grade
foundations and foundations that are entirely below-grade, are not
at risk of damage from wildfires.Other types of foundations that are
susceptible to damage in a wildfire are:
Closed foundations, in which the foundation walls are typically load-•
bearing.The below-grade portion of the foundation walls are usually
constructed of concrete or masonry.The above-grade portion can
also be constructed of concrete or masonry or constructed of a stud
wall, commonly called a cripple wall.

The wall encloses a basement
or crawl space, and the cripple wall often has vents to allow air
circulation in the crawl space or basement�
Open foundations, in which the building rests on piers or piles and the •
underside of the first floor is exposed.Causes of damage: Radiant heat, flames, embers, and firebrands
can enter foundations through damaged windows, wall penetrations,
or cripple wall vents or, in the case of open foundations, may directly
affect the piers or piles, framing, and subflooring of the building.Wildfire
elements can ignite columns, subflooring, and combustible  materials,
such as contents of a basement within the foundation� For buildings with
cripple walls, the cripple wall may ignite if it is composed of combustible
materials�
For mitigation measures associated with vents, wall penetrations, and
windows, see Sections B, C, and F.

Introduction:  Building equipment such as mechanical, electrical, and
heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems is often installed at
the exterior of a building � Equipment can be mounted on the rooftop, on
ground-level pads, or on exterior walls� The equipment connections often
penetrate the building envelope �
Causes of damage: Building equipment is vulnerable to damage
when exposed to wildfire.The equipment can have highly combustible
components, such as fuel tanks, that are vulnerable to ignition from
radiant heat, direct contact with flames, and ember intrusion.Once
these components ignite, the resulting fire may ignite the building.Sensitive instruments and wiring are examples of components that can
be damaged by wildfires.Additionally, electronic equipment that requires
a consistent power source is also vulnerable to operational failure during
a wildfire.Building equipment commonly damaged in a

Utilities 67II.uTI lITIeS
Introduction:  Utilities include systems that are related to power, water,
waste management, and communications.The greatest risk of fire
damage is to above-grade utilities.Underground systems (storm drains,
sewer and water lines and in some cases power lines), by virtue of the
insulating capacity of the earth, generally have a low risk of damage
from wildfire.In power distribution and communication systems,
however, the portions of the equipment that must remain above-ground
may be subject to damage.Utility components vulnerable to wildfire damage may include:
Utility station buildings used to house equipment such as pump •
houses�
Above-ground utility equipment that is exposed to the elements.

•
Examples are tanks, meters, pumps, telemetry equipment, utility
risers, pole- or pad-mounted transformers, electrical substations, and
cell phone and radio towers�
Utility distribution systems such as pipes used for drinking water and •
sewage treatment and wires and cables mounted on poles for power
and communication systems.Stored materials such as chemicals.Municipal treatment plants, •
commercial operations and industrial operations often use and store
toxic chemicals that can ignite and be released into the environment�
Causes of damage:  Typical wildfire damage to utilities is described
below �
water storage and distribution systems:  Storage facilities include
reservoirs and tanks.Distribution systems include pipes, pumping
stations, treatment facilities, and wells� Chemicals used in treatment
are volatile, are subject to explosion, and can omit toxic gases � Intense
heat has the potential to damage pipes and pumping equipment that lie
above-grade and facilities such as wood storage tanks.Wildfires can also
damage the power supply to pumping stations and equipment used to
control and monitor system operations.Power plants and transmission lines:  The primary risk is to
transmission towers and the lines that carry the electricity.High winds
that often accompany wildfires can cause contact between energized
conductors, resulting in power disruption�
radio and communications systems: Systems typically contain heat-
sensitive components such as transfer panels and insulated cables�
68 Utilitiesutility poles and lines:  Utility (electric, telephone, or cable) equipment
is often installed on poles.Poles and lines can be damaged by falling
debris during a fire.Poles are made primarily from pressure-treated
wood that is resistant to ignition but will burn under intense heat�
Power outages and power surges caused by wind and fire can damage
electrically powered equipment miles away.electrical transformers:  Electrical transformers are devices used to
change the voltage of an alternating current in one circuit to a different
voltage in a second circuit� Transformers can be mounted on a pole
or on the ground � Most transformers contain oil that can burn under
intense heat � Explosions can result when the transformers are exposed
to wildfires.Although most transformers containing polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) are being phased out, some transformer failure can
release potentially harmful chemicals.


to wildfires.Although most transformers containing polychlorinated
biphenyls (PCBs) are being phased out, some transformer failure can
release potentially harmful chemicals.

utility risers and service drops:  Electrical, telephone, and cable can
run overhead or underground to individual buildings � Overhead utilities
can be damaged by flames, heat, or falling limbs.Most portions of
underground utilities are less vulnerable, but the riser poles where the
utility transitions from overhead to underground remain vulnerable,
particularly when non-metallic conduit (such as polyvinyl chlorides [PVC])
or nonmetallic guards are used�

Utilities 69a.1 enclose equipment or Chemicals in fire- or heat-
resistant building or enclosure
description of Mitigation Measure: For larger equipment, construct a
fire-resistant  building to house the equipment using  ignition-resistant
construction standards (see Section I).For smaller  equipment and
the storage of hazardous materials, use pre-fabricated or custom-
made enclosures made of heat- or fire-resistant material to completely
enclose these items � Install a concrete pad at the base or build a
noncombustible  wall around the equipment to create defensible space �
effectiveness:  For the effectiveness of fire-resistant buildings, refer to
Sections I.A–I.D.Above-ground systems enclosed in appropriate metal
or concrete enclosures are effective in moderate and high fire severity
zones.

design Issues:  Equipment in fire-resistant enclosures must continue to
operate at capacity and may have certain ventilation and accessibility

pole with  fire retardant  or replace it with noncombustible  steel or spun
concrete material � A wooden tank can be replaced with one made of
fire-resistant material such as ferrocement.Install a concrete pad at the
base or construct a fire-resistant wall (see Section IV) around the facility
to create defensible space �
effectiveness: Using fire-resistant materials is effective for reducing
vulnerability to wildfire damage in all fire severity zones.Fire-retardant

78 Fences and WallsIv.fenCeS  and w allS
Introduction: Fences and walls function as physical or visual barriers or
architectural statements� Fences and walls are constructed from a wide
range of materials and often include combustible components such as
wooded posts and railings or materials that can melt, such as vinyl.Causes of damage:  Wildfire damage is typically the result of ignition or
melting of the fence or wall construction materials� Ignition or melting
may result from radiant heat, direct contact with flames, or contact
with blowing embers and firebrands.Fences and walls have large
surface areas that often contain cracks, openings, and rough areas,
or are wire barriers � All of these characteristics increase the risk that
fences and walls will trap fire elements.The potential for ignition is
also related to the condition of the fence or wall: its age, the amount of
debris accumulated adjacent to or on the fence, and the proximity to
combustible vegetation or general landscaping�
If the fence or wall is connected or adjacent to a building, it may
provide a path for the spread of flames to that building.Conversely,
noncombustible  walls can function as a flame deflector and thus add to
the fire defense of an adjacent building.Wildfire mitigation measures for fences and walls

88 BridgesvI.brIdgeS
Introduction: Bridges are constructed with a wide range of designs �
In general, they are constructed of wood, timber, steel, concrete, or a
combination of these materials � Bridges have a critical function during a
wildfire to facilitate evacuation and provide access for firefighters.

Once a
bridge becomes structurally unsound, evacuation and firefighter access
are curtailed � The result is a loss of access through an area for as long
as several months�
Causes of damage: Wildfire damage to bridges is typically the result
of the ignition of bridge construction materials� The fire resistance  of
a bridge is dependent on the material and methods that were used to
construct it�
The structural components of a bridge are exposed to the environment �
Additionally, bridges often span vegetated areas or areas where debris
has accumulated or are adjacent to vegetated areas, increasing
exposure to wildfire elements.Large, flat surfaces such as decking
provide exposure to wildfire elements, and blowing embers and
firebrands may be trapped in open structural elements or underneath
the bridge �
Wildfires typically cause the following types of damages in bridges:
Decking made of combustible material is ignited and damaged.As •
a result, the decking may no longer be able to carry the required
loading�
Combustible framing in the superstructure or substructure is •

section does not include a discussion of post-fire measures to stabilize
burned slopes and prevent erosion, excessive runoff, or debris flows.

Causes of damage: Retaining walls and erosion-control structures are
often constructed:
Of combustible materials, such as wood and timbers•
In heavily vegetated areas and areas where vegetative debris •
accumulates
On slopes and are consequently often in the direct path of an •
approaching wildfire
Nearby vegetation and accumulated debris may ignite and provide a
path for flames to come into contact with the facility.Large, flat surfaces,
exposed structural components, and cracks and gaps in walls increase
the potential for contact with, or trapping of, blowing embers and
firebrands.Once ignited, the structure itself may become an additional
source of fuel and pose a threat to nearby buildings and other facilities.Mitigation measures for retaining walls and
erosion-control structures from common wildfire damage are discussed in the following section:

Hazard Mitigation Funding under Section 406 (Stafford Act)
TITLE: I.Hazard Mitigation Funding Under Section 406 (Stafford Act)
DATE: II.July 30, 2007
PURPOSE: III.Provide guidance on the appropriate use of hazard mitigation discretionary
funding available under Section 406 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster
Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (Stafford Act), 42 U.S.C.5121-5206.This will ensure national consistency in the use of Section 406 mitigation
funds and promote measures that reduce future loss to life and property,
protect the federal investment in public infrastructure and ultimately, help
build disaster resistant communities.SCOPE AND AUDIENCE: IV.This policy applies to all disasters declared after publication of this
document.It is intended to guide all personnel responsible for the
administration of the FEMA Public Assistance Grant Program.AUTHORITIES AND REFERENCES: V.
Section 406 (e) of the Stafford Act and Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations
(CFR) § 206.226.BACKGROUND: VI.A.The Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance
Act provides FEMA the authority to fund the restoration of eligible
facilities that have sustained damage due to a Presidentially
declared disaster.Section 406 of the Stafford Act contains a
provision for the consideration of funding additional measures
(further described in 44 CFR § 206.226) that will enhance a
facility’s ability to resist similar damage in future events.1.In providing discretionary authority for the addition of hazard
mitigation measures to permanent work restoration, Congress
recognized that during the repair of damaged components
A-2 Appendix Aof facilities there would be a unique opportunity to prevent
recurrence of similar damage from future, similar disaster
events.

 to permanent work restoration, Congress
recognized that during the repair of damaged components
A-2 Appendix Aof facilities there would be a unique opportunity to prevent
recurrence of similar damage from future, similar disaster
events.

Such measures are in addition to any measures
undertaken to comply with applicable codes and standards,
although such compliance, itself, could be considered a form
of mitigation.2.Section 406 hazard mitigation funding and Section 404 hazard
mitigation funding are distinct.Section 406 is applied on
the parts of the facility that were actually damaged by the
disaster and the mitigation measure provides protection from
subsequent events.The mitigation work must be cost effective
and be reasonably performed as part of the work or measure
which will reduce the potential for damage to a facility from
a disaster event.Sometimes, a combination of Section 406
and 404 funding may be appropriate, where Section 406
hazard mitigation funding is used to provide protection to
the parts of the facility that were damaged and Section 404
hazard mitigation funding is used to provide protection to
the undamaged parts of the facility.In these instances, the
application for Section 404 hazard mitigation funding must be
submitted in a timely manner, consistent with State and local
hazard mitigation plans, and approved by the State Hazard
Mitigation Officer.3.FEMA may provide discretionary hazard mitigation funding
under Section 406 of the Stafford Act.FEMA, Grantee and
subgrantee’s interests in disaster resistance must be balanced
with the supplemental nature of disaster assistance and
FEMA’s obligation for the prudent stewardship of Federal
disaster funds.4.Only FEMA is authorized to interpret and implement the
Stafford Act and regulations issued pursuant to the Stafford
Act.Accordingly, only FEMA has the authority to determine
which hazard mitigation measures it will fund.The Stafford
Act and applicable regulations do not authorize State or local
building officials or agencies to determine the amount of
hazard mitigation funding FEMA will contribute to a project.POLICY: VII.A.Section 406 provides discretionary authority to fund mitigation
measures in conjunction with the repair of the disaster-damaged
facilities.These opportunities usually present themselves during
Appendix A  A-3the repair efforts.The mitigation measures must be related to
eligible disaster-related damages and must directly reduce the
potential of future, similar disaster damages to the eligible facility.This work is performed on the parts of the facility that were
actually damaged by the disaster and the mitigation measure
provides protection from subsequent events.Exceptions to this
provision will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

 of the facility that were
actually damaged by the disaster and the mitigation measure
provides protection from subsequent events.Exceptions to this
provision will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

B. Mitigation measures must be determined to be cost-effective.Any one of the following means may be used to determine cost-
effectiveness:
1.Mitigation measures may amount to up to 15% of the total
eligible cost of the eligible repair work on a particular project.2.Certain mitigation measures (see Appendix A) determined
cost-effective, as long as the mitigation measure does not
exceed 100% of the eligible cost of the eligible repair work on
the project.3.For measures that exceed the above costs, the Grantee or
subgrantee must demonstrate through an acceptable benefit/
cost analysis methodology that the measure is cost-effective.FEMA’s Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) software provides
appropriate benefit/cost analysis methodologies.You can
obtain the software from FEMA by contacting the BCA
helpline at 1-866-222-3580, e-mail (bchelpline@dhs.gov),
or the applicable FEMA Regional Office.Alternative benefit/
cost methodologies will only be considered acceptable if the
Grantee or subgrantee receives and submits written approval
from the FEMA Regional Office and FEMA Headquarters
prior to the submission of the mitigation proposal.The benefit/
cost analysis will be based on a comparison of the total project
cost to the total cost of the following benefits: 1) damage to
the facility and its damaged contents, 2) emergency protective
measures required as a result of that damage, and 3) temporary
facilities required due to the damage.C. If a facility has Section 406 hazard mitigation funding included
in the approved scope of work (SOW) and the subgrantee wishes
to restore the facility to its pre-disaster condition and function
without  the Section 406 hazard mitigation SOW, then the
subgrantee must request a change of SOW prior to completion
of the project.Section 406 hazard mitigation funds must be de-
obligated when the subgrantee does not use the funds as approved
in the SOW.A-4 Appendix AD.Proposed hazard mitigation projects must be approved by FEMA
prior to funding.They will be evaluated for cost effectiveness,
technical feasibility, and compliance with statutory, regulatory,
and executive order requirements.

 evaluated for cost effectiveness,
technical feasibility, and compliance with statutory, regulatory,
and executive order requirements.

In addition, the evaluation must
ensure that the mitigation measures do not cause a negative impact
to the facility’s operation, surrounding areas, or susceptibility to
damage from another hazard.E. The costs of meeting applicable codes/standards in accordance
with 44 CFR § 206.226 (d) and minimum National Flood
Insurance Program requirements are regulatory requirements that
are distinct from hazard mitigation.Funding for these costs is
considered separately.F. When the cost of proposed replacement material for a damaged
component is more than the original material, the proposed
material must be shown to be cost effective.G. There may be no duplication in hazard mitigation funding between
Sections 404 and 406.Therefore, the Grantee and subgrantee
must be able to identify specific hazard mitigation work that
will be accomplished with funding through Section 406.Section
404 funding may not duplicate that work, although Section 404
may be additive and accomplished on Section 406 facilities.The
appropriate split on a project between funds under Sections 404
and 406 is a FEMA decision.Sections 404 and 406 funding cannot
be used to meet the non-federal cost share of the other grant.H. Funds recommended for mitigation measures may be approved
for an improved project if the original facility and its function will
be restored and the mitigation work is still needed, is technically
feasible, and will be performed as part of the overall project.Facilities eligible for replacement under 44 CFR 206.226(f) -
Repair vs. replacement  are not eligible for mitigation measures.1.If mitigation measures are approved for the repair of a disaster-
damaged facility and the subgrantee requests an improved
project which will instead involve the replacement of the
facility, on the same site or an alternate site, the cost of the
mitigation measures is not eligible.2.The cost of mitigation measures approved under Section
406 for the repair of a facility may not be applied towards an
Alternate Project.I.Early in a disaster the FEMA and State PA Officers, in consultation
with the Hazard Mitigation Group Supervisor, should issue a
Appendix A  A-5Memorandum of Understanding outlining how 406 mitigation
will be addressed for the disaster, including what measures will
be emphasized, making linkages to codes and standards and
availability and integration of other mitigation programs.RESPONSIBLE OFFICE: VIII.

potential Mitigation Measures
That Are pre-determined to Be Cost effective
The following potential mitigation measures (reference: paragraph VII.B.2)
are determined to be cost-effective if they:
do not exceed 100% of project cost, •
are appropriate to the disaster damage, •
will prevent future similar damage, •
are directly related to the eligible damaged elements, •
do not increase risks or cause adverse effects to the property or •
elsewhere,
are technically feasible for the hazard and location, and•
otherwise meet requirements stipulated in this policy, including •
environmental, historic, and mitigation planning considerations.This list will continue to be evaluated and will evolve over time as new
information becomes available.General I.A. Drainage/crossings and bridges
1.Drainage structures – When drainage structures are destroyed,
replacing the structure with multiple structures or a larger
structure.Sizing of replacement culverts can be made using
in-place state/local drainage criteria (nomographs).However,
structures need to be considered with regard to a total drainage
system and should not be upgraded without a watershed
hydrology study with an emphasis on downstream effects and
NFIP [National Flood Insurance Program] regulations.2.Culverts – Where the alignment of culverts is inconsistent with
streams flowing through them (because it has been blown-
out), realign or relocate the culverts to improve hydraulics and
minimize erosion.However, realignment of structures must be
considered in regard to a total drainage system and shall not
be replaced without a hydrology study with an emphasis on
downstream erosion effects.3.Headwalls and wing walls – Installation to control erosion.4.Low-water crossings – When bridges are destroyed and where
traffic counts are low, replacing bridges with carefully placed
low-water crossings.Appendix A  A-75.

 walls – Installation to control erosion.4.Low-water crossings – When bridges are destroyed and where
traffic counts are low, replacing bridges with carefully placed
low-water crossings.Appendix A  A-75.

Gabion baskets, riprap, sheet-piling, and geotextile fabric
installation – Installation to control erosion.6.Roadways – Where roadways shoulders are damaged by
overflow from adjacent water courses, stabilize shoulders and
embankments with geotextile fabric.7.Restraining cables on bridges – Installation of cables to
restrain a bridge from being knocked off piers or abutments
during floods or earthquakes.Also, where bridges have been
damaged or destroyed when girders, beams and decking
system are displaced by storm surges or earthquakes, install
girder and deck uplift tie-downs to prevent their displacement
from the substructure.B. Sanitary and storm sewer systems
1.Access covers – When feasible, access covers can be elevated
to the hydraulic grade line.There are a number of devices that
prevent infiltration into access holes.2.Sewer lines – Repair, lining or encasement of damaged
sections to prevent infiltration or structural collapse.3.Pump stations –
a.Equipment or controls in a pump station that are subject
to damage from the 100- year flood can be elevated.Pump
station buildings can be dry flood-proofed.b.Installation of camlocks, transfer switches, and electrical
panels to facilitate the connection of portable emergency
generators.c. Pump stations – If pumps and their attached motors are
damaged by storm water inundation, replace them with
submersible or inline pumps as appropriate.d. Pump stations – If pump station equipment is damaged as
a result of inundation resulting from power failure, install
switches, circuit isolation and/quick connect capability to
facilitate rapid connection of backup power.C. Wastewater treatment plants
1.Elevation of equipment and controls that can be elevated
easily.2.Dry or wet flood-proofing of buildings.A-8 Appendix AD.Potable water
1.Well systems –
a.Reduction of infiltration and subsequent contamination of
the aquifer.Methods include casing the well or raising the
elevation of the well head.b. Elevation of controls, mechanical equipment, or electri -
cal service associated with use of the well to protect them
from flood damage.2.Raw water intakes - Buttressing to prevent damage from
erosion, scour, and flood debris.3.

1.Pad-mounted transformers – elevating above the base flood
elevation.2.Using multiple poles to support transformers.3.Anchoring or otherwise protecting fuel tanks from movement
in a disaster.4.Replacing damaged poles with higher-rated poles, of the same
or different material such as replacing wood poles with precast
concrete or steel.5.Adding guy wire or additional support to power lines.6.Removing large diameter lines from poles.7.Providing looped distribution service or other redundancies in
the electrical service to critical facilities.F. Above ground storage tanks
1.Strengthening or stiffening base connections.2.Installation of self-initiating disconnects and shut-off values
between tanks and distribution lines to minimize damage and
leaks.G. Underground pipelines – Installation of shut-off valves so that
damaged sections of pipeline can be isolated.Appendix A  A-9Buildings: II.A.General effects of flood damage –
1.Buildings substantially damaged under NFIP regulations –
Repair, dry flood-proofing, or elevation so they are protected
to meet minimum NFIP regulations.If the building is
replaced, rather than repaired, minimum NFIP requirements
are generally in place as codes and standards in participating
communities and are applicable in both repair and replacement
situation.Section 406 mitigation should be considered in those
cases where these standards either fall short or provide no
protection against other hazards.2.Buildings not substantially damaged under NFIP regulations
– If technically feasible, dry flood-proofing.Electrical panels,
machinery rooms, emergency generators can be elevated above
the BFE [Base Flood Elevation] or dry flood-proofed.If dry
flood-proofing is not feasible, these buildings should be wet
flood-proofed.B. Roofs – Because the failure of a roof covering can lead to
extensive damage to contents and operation, damaged roofing
should be evaluated to determine cause of failure.1.Low slope roofs – Replacement of the entire roof with a roof
covering with a secondary membrane and a fully adhered roof
covering, such as modified bitumen.

 evaluated to determine cause of failure.1.Low slope roofs – Replacement of the entire roof with a roof
covering with a secondary membrane and a fully adhered roof
covering, such as modified bitumen.

Mechanically fastened
insulation or membranes are not acceptable.2.Roof-mounted equipment should be attached to a foundation
that will resist expected wind forces.3.Hurricane clips – Hurricane clips for use in high-wind areas.4.Roofs – When roof damages are due to wind pressure beneath
soffits and overhangs, strengthen the soffit and overhang
material and means of attachment to prevent wind pressure
adversely affecting the roofing system.5.Roofs – When there is roof system damage or water intrusion
due to damage to roof opening such as hatches and skylights
strengthen the openings or the windows to avoid future
damage.6.Roofs – For gable roofs damaged by wind, replace the gable
end-framing with hipped roof framing to reduce wind forces
(lower edge pressure; reduced projected wind area) and
strengthen the roof framing.A-10  Appendix AC.Shutters – In areas subject to hurricane winds, shutters are
appropriate in the following areas:
1.All damaged windows on critical facilities such as hospitals.2.The lower floors of buildings with damaged windows most
likely to be struck by debris.3.Damaged windows of buildings with very high value contents
that can be damaged by water (such as libraries and document
centers).4.Damaged windows of buildings subject to debris from nearby
ballasted roofs, metal buildings, manufactured homes or other
structures likely to fail and result in debris.D. Anchoring –
1.Anchoring of mechanical and electrical equipment in critical
facilities.2.For small ancillary buildings that have sustained damage and/
or have caused damage to other facilities, anchor the buildings
to foundations to prevent toppling or becoming missile
hazards.E. Flexible piping – Installation of flexible piping at pipe/conduit
connections to equipment to accommodate expected movement in
an earthquake.F. Bracing –
1.Bracing of and large diameter pipes and electrical lines to meet
seismic loads.2.Bracing non structural interior walls and partitions.3.Bracing parapets, anchoring veneer or cladding, and bracing
other non-structural elements that could collapse and cause
injury or block safe exit of a building during an earthquake.G. Replacement of glass – Replacement of glass with impact-resistant
material.

er or cladding, and bracing
other non-structural elements that could collapse and cause
injury or block safe exit of a building during an earthquake.G. Replacement of glass – Replacement of glass with impact-resistant
material.

H. General Buildings –
1.Buildings – Where spread footings have been undercut by
scour, underpin footings.2.Siding – if siding has been damage by wind, replace with a
stronger siding with stronger attachments to the wall sheathing
and structure.Appendix A  A-113.Venting – Where there has been water damage caused by water
intrusion through venting systems, replace the vents with rain
and water resistant vents.I.Doors and Windows –
1.Where damage has resulted from wind and water intrusion
around weather stripping on doors and/or windows, upgrade
the weather stripping to prevent water infiltration.2.Where damage has been caused by wind-induced failure of
doors, replace the doors with stronger units.This applies to the
door frame, door, hinges, and lock hardware.Both entry and
garage doors should be considered.J. Miscellaneous Structures –
1.Marine Piers – If marine piers ramps that attach to decking
have been damaged by storm-surge uplift and buoyancy, install
open decking or floating decking with uplift-resistant tie-
downs and fasteners.2.Signage – If sign panels and their supports have failed,
replace with a stronger type of system of supports and panels.Consider using multiple support posts and stronger panels and
fasteners.3.Gutters and Downspouts – If damaged by either wind and/or
water, upgrade the gutter and downspout system to directing
water away from the structure and preventing interior or
basement water damage.Appendix B B-1Appendix B

As described in the “How to Use this Handbook” section above, FEMA
must consider a range of Federal environmental and historic preservation
laws, regulations, and Executive Orders that apply to the use of Federal
funds when evaluating proposed mitigation measures under the PA Program.Requirements that commonly apply to PA Program mitigation measures are
identified below.For more detailed information on FEMA’s environmental

322, Public Assistance Guide  (FEMA, 2007) or the FEMA website at

National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).NEPA requires every Federal
agency to follow a specific planning process to ensure that agency decision-
makers have considered, and the general public is fully informed about, the environmental consequences of a proposed Federal action, such as the approval of a grant.This review and consultation process is used to
evaluate the impact a project, and any possible alternatives, may have on
the environment.The process must be completed prior to obligating funds and beginning work.NEPA does not require that FEMA limit the impact of projects on the environment; nor does it require FEMA to fund only the alternative that has the least environmental impact.However, it does require
that the decision to fund a project be made in an informed manner.FEMA’s
regulations regarding NEPA can be found in 44 CFR Part 10.National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA).The NHPA requires a
Federal agency to consider, before approval of funding, the effects of its
activities, referred to as “undertakings,” on any historic property listed
in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.The agency funding the undertaking is required to give the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation a reasonable opportunity to comment on that
undertaking.Under the NHPA regulations, which can be found in 36 CFR
Part 800, PA Program projects are considered undertakings because they are funded in whole or in part by a Federal agency.Historic properties include districts, buildings, structures, objects, landscapes, archaeological sites, and traditional cultural properties that are listed in or eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places, a Federally maintained
list of recognized historic properties.

 properties include districts, buildings, structures, objects, landscapes, archaeological sites, and traditional cultural properties that are listed in or eligible for
listing in the National Register of Historic Places, a Federally maintained
list of recognized historic properties.

These properties are not limited to old buildings or well-known historic sites, but include places important in local, State, tribal, or national history.Facilities as diverse as bridges, roads, water treatment plants, and areas once inhabited by Native American populations
may be considered historic properties.Endangered Species Act (ESA).Section 7 of the ESA prohibits Federal
actions that cause takings of species listed as threatened or endangered, or the destruction or adverse modification of the habitat for these species.Endangered species include mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, amphibians,
plants, and insects.If a project has the potential to affect a threatened or endangered species or its habitat, FEMA must consult with the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Services or the National Marine Fisheries Service, or both, before approving funding for that project.While compliance issues may
Appendix B B-3arise with projects involving undisturbed sites or sites in or by waterways,
they could also arise with relatively minor actions.executive Order 11988 – Floodplain Management, and executive
Order 11990 – p rotection of Wetlands.These Executive Orders require
Federal agencies to minimize or avoid activity that adversely affects
floodplains and wetlands.Because many PA Program projects are located in
these areas, FEMA must review proposed projects for compliance with the
requirements of these orders.Through this review, FEMA seeks to:
Avoid, to the extent possible, short- and long-term adverse impacts •
associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains.Avoid direct and indirect support of floodplain development wherever •
there is a practicable alternative.Minimize the destruction, loss, or degradation of wetlands.•
FEMA’s regulations for applying these Executive Orders are outlined in •
44 CFR Part 9.These regulations describe a specific, eight-step process
for conducting floodplain management and wetland reviews before
approval of funding.Appendix C C-1Appendix C

defensible Space
The defensible Space Concept
Defensible space refers to the fuel characteristics around a facility and
how those characteristics can potentially affect fire behavior.The term is
applied generally within the context of wildland fires and to facilities in the
wildland/urban interface.The objective of defensible space is to modify
fuel characteristics around a facility to reduce the potential for extreme fire
behavior, with the goal of providing firefighters an area in which they may
operate safely to save the structure from being consumed by an approaching
fire.Defensible space by itself may not save a facility from burning.However,
when combined with appropriate structural mitigation, defensible space may
decrease the risk to the facility.Without defensible space, firefighters may
not even attempt to save a facility from being consumed by an approaching
wildfire because the safety risk is too great.Defensible space is one of the
components that firefighters assess when deciding whether to attempt to
save a facility.Benefits of Defensible Space
Benefits of creating defensible space around a facility include:
Reduces hazards for firefighters.•
Firefighters may attempt to save the facility from an approaching fire.•
Greater likelihood that firefighters will succeed in saving the facility from •
being consumed by fire.Greater possibility that the facility will survive an approaching fire •
without sustaining major damage if fire suppression resources are not
available.Reduces the burden on fire-suppression resources during an emergency.•
Improves the likelihood that the facility will survive the fire when used in •
conjunction with appropriate structural mitigation measures.Code Requirements
Defensible space requirements vary by location and depend on the training
of local authorities with jurisdiction.All firefighting agencies are not
equipped and trained the same way.A local State lands agency office, local
fire department, or county tax assessor’s office should be able to provide
information about defensible space requirements.D-2  Appendix DAlthough there are no national codified requirements for defensible space,
there are some general standards.

 defensible space requirements.D-2  Appendix DAlthough there are no national codified requirements for defensible space,
there are some general standards.

The National Fire Protection Association
published the following standards for defensible space (NFPA, 2002):
Establish a fuel modification area extending 30 feet in all directions from •
the facility.Ground fuels within the defined defensible space shall be treated or •
removed.Live vegetation within the defensible space shall have dead material •
removed and shall be thinned and pruned.Dead and/or downed fuels within the defensible space of facilities shall •
be removed or treated to maintain the fuel modification area.Vegetation under trees within the fuel modification area shall be •
maintained at a height that will preclude ground fire from spreading into
the tree canopy.Maintain the defensible space as needed.•
Propane tanks and other combustible liquids storage shall conform •
to NFPA 30, Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code, NFPA 58,
Liquefied Petroleum Gas Code, and the local or State Wildland Fire Risk
and Hazard Mitigation Plan.Specific Practices
In Protecting and Landscaping Homes in the Wildland/Urban Interface
(Barkley et al., 2005), the authors suggest creating a defensible space by
taking the actions listed below in three concentric zones radiating outward
from a structure.The measures are focused on structures but can be applied
to any facility.Zone 1:•  The structure itself.Decrease the ignition potential of the
structure by choosing nonflammable roofing materials and siding, enclose
decks, soffits and overhangs, and removing debris from roofs and gutters.Cover house vents with wire mesh.See Section I (Buildings) of the
Handbook.Zone 2: • The landscape within 100 feet of the structure.Surround the
structure by a greenbelt of well watered and maintained plants.Plant
perennials, ground cover, and annuals in groups with individual trees and
shrubs.Surround these islands of vegetation with rock or brick retaining
walls and well-watered turf.Remove overgrowth and dry debris on the
ground every three to five years and prune trees.Store firewood on a
gravel pad surrounded by well-watered turf.Zone 3: • Beyond 100 feet.Thin native plants.If possible remove highly
flammable vegetation and replace with less fire-prone species.

Hurricane season is the time of year when the tropical ocean waters warm
and the atmospheric winds moisten.It is during this period that the eastern
seaboard and gulf coast communities of the United States hope for a quiet
season while governmental agencies prepare for the worst.Unlike natural di-
sasters such as earthquakes and wildﬁres, the destructive paths of hurricanes
can be predicted to some degree.Preparedness and adherence to recommen-
ded evacuation orders can and do save lives.Like other disasters, however,
nature is an unpredictable force that can result in signiﬁcant destruction,
injury, and loss of life [1].Systems at multiple levels, not the least of which
is medical, may be stressed and must execute well-designed and practiced
plans to function optimally.Plans are built on experience and on what to ex-
pect.For medical systems, these plans include the prehospital emergency
medical systems, hospitals, and individual physicians.Although medical
needs can vary as much as the strength of the storm, similarities exist across
all windstorms.Knowledge of and preparation for these needs are what build
eﬀective plans.* Corresponding author.Division of Trauma, Burns, and Surgical Critical Care,

What is a hurricane?A hurricane is a tropical storm with winds that have reached a sustained
speed of 74 miles per hour (mph) or more.Hurricane winds blow in a large
spiral around a relatively calm center known as the ‘‘eye.’’ The eye is gener-
ally 20 to 30 miles wide, and the storm may extend outward 400 miles.As
a hurricane nears land, it can bring torrential rains, high winds, and storm
surges.A single hurricane can last for more than 2 weeks over open waters
and can run a path across the entire length of the eastern seaboard.August
and September are peak months during the hurricane season, which lasts
from June 1 through November 30.Windstorms are classiﬁed by category based on the speed of the sustained
winds (Saﬃr-Simpson Hurricane Scale).Tropical depressions are organized
systems of clouds and thunderstorms with a deﬁned circulation and maxi -
mum sustained winds of 38 mph or less.A tropical storm is an organized
system of strong thunderstorms with a deﬁned circulation and maximum
sustained winds of 39 to 73 mph.Intense tropical weather systems with
a well-deﬁned circulation and maximum sustained winds of 74 mph or
higher become hurricanes.Hurricanes are called typhoons in the western
Paciﬁc, whereas similar storms in the Indian Ocean are called cyclones.Although the most destructive hurricanes aﬀecting the United States form
in the Atlantic Ocean, hurricanes can also form in the Gulf of Mexico, the
Indian Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Paciﬁc Ocean.Hurricane winds
in the Northern Hemisphere circulate in a counterclockwise motion around
the hurricane’s eye, whereas hurricane winds in the Southern Hemisphere cir-
culate clockwise.Natural phenomena that aﬀect a storm include temperature
of the water, the Gulf Stream, and steering wind currents.

the hurricane’s eye, whereas hurricane winds in the Southern Hemisphere cir-
culate clockwise.Natural phenomena that aﬀect a storm include temperature
of the water, the Gulf Stream, and steering wind currents.

Powered by heat
from the sea, storms are steered by the easterly trade wind, the temperate
westerlies, and by their own ferocious energy.Around their core, winds
grow with great velocity, generating violent seas.Moving ashore, they sweep
the ocean inward while spawning tornadoes and producing torrential rains
and ﬂoods.In addition to the violent winds, the storm surge, which generates
subsequent ﬂooding, is the major source of destruction on land.Although the damage inﬂicted by a hurricane diﬀers with the terrain it
encounters, the structural integrity of the buildings hit, the population den-
sity, the tide levels at the time of landfall, and the potential property damage
and ﬂooding expected along the coast can be estimated.Category 1 storms,
with winds of 74 to 95 mph, produce no real damage to building structures;
damage is limited primarily to unanchored mobile homes, shrubbery, and
trees.Some coastal road ﬂooding and minor pier damage may occur.Cate-
gory 2 storms (winds 96–110 mph) result in some rooﬁng material, door,
and window damage.Considerable devastation to vegetation, mobile
homes, and piers can be expected.Coastal and low-lying escape routes ﬂood
2 to 4 hours before the arrival of the center of the storm, and small craft in
unprotected anchorages break their moorings.Category 3 hurricanes (winds

111–130 mph) cause some structural damage to small residences and utility
buildings, with a minor amount of curtainwall (non–weight-bearing panels
suspended on the exterior of multistory structures between supporting col-
umns) failures.Mobile homes are destroyed.Flooding near the coast de-
stroys smaller structures, with larger structures damaged by ﬂoating
debris.Terrain lower than 5 feet above sea level may be ﬂooded 8 miles
or more inland.As the winds increase to 131 to 155 mph (category 4),
more extensive curtainwall failures occur, with some complete roof structure
failure on small residences.

more extensive curtainwall failures occur, with some complete roof structure
failure on small residences.

Major erosion of the beach and major damage to
lower ﬂoors of structures near the shore can be expected.Terrain lower than
10 feet above sea level may be ﬂooded, requiring massive evacuation of res-
idential areas as far as 6 miles inland.Top-level hurricanes (category 5: sus-
tained winds O155 mph) produce complete roof failure on many residences
and industrial buildings.Some complete building failures, with small utility
buildings blown over or away, can be seen.Major damage occurs to lower
ﬂoors of all structures located less than 15 feet above sea level and within
500 yards of the shoreline, which may require massive evacuation of residen-
tial areas on low ground within 5 to 10 miles of the shoreline.Prestorm medical issues
With current-day communications, an approaching storm should be
a surprise to no one.The National Hurricane Center, located in Miami,
Florida, tracks storms from their inception, and has performed well in pre-
dicting the power and anticipated landfall location of most recent storms.With these predictions comes the ability to prepare, which for most involves
the accumulation of supplies (water, food, ﬂashlights, batteries), the secur-
ing of property (debris removal and placement of hurricane shutters), and
evacuation.An adequate supply of prescription medications and supplies
(syringes for diabetics, dressings for those who have recent wounds) must
be anticipated and obtained.For those planning to weather the storm at
home, placing these supplies in a safe room (away from windows and out-
side doors) should be done.Adequate supplies of fuel for personal vehicles
and generators (in the event of power loss) need to be obtained before the
storm arrives.These activities, representing only a partial list of the imme-
diate preparation required, produce a very stressful environment.As anxiety levels mount, errors occur that can lead to medical emergen-
cies.Hurricane shutters can cause serious injury.These shutters are made of
aluminum with very sharp edges and, in bulk, can be very heavy.Falling
shutters have resulted in extensive lacerations and even death from head in-
juries.As people rush to accomplish their goals, motor vehicle accidents are
also a concern.As the storm approaches, emergency medical support disappears.

 have resulted in extensive lacerations and even death from head in-
juries.As people rush to accomplish their goals, motor vehicle accidents are
also a concern.As the storm approaches, emergency medical support disappears.

Heli-
copters are typically grounded when wind speeds approach 45 mph.Opera -
tion of high-proﬁle ground ambulances becomes risky at wind speeds of
548 SHATZ et al
45 mph, and dispatch of ﬁre suppression units may terminate at wind speeds
of 55 mph.Persons who have serious illness and injuries at this point
become nontransportable.Weathering the storm
The excitement of increasing winds and rain can be quickly replaced by
substantial concern when that rain becomes torrential and the winds rattle
structures.Fear that those structures may fail begins to mount.As power
lines are downed, communication with relatives and news agencies is lost,
and protective structures are left in darkness.Structures built to hurricane
standards often do well; however, for structures not typically in hurri-
cane-prone areas and those not built to the stringent standards of hurricane
building codes, structure failure can occur.Total roof failure exposes those
inside to ﬂying debris.Many have been injured or killed when falling trees
struck and collapsed houses.Reports of people wishing to go outside to ex-
perience the storm and being struck by ﬂying debris (often with fatal results)
are frequent.Poststorm problems
As the storm passes, a sense of relief is quickly followed by one of awe or
one of despair at ﬁrst sight of the resulting damage.Here is where the real
medical problems begin.Power outages may be limited to neighborhoods or entire counties, last-
ing hours to months.With the lack of power comes the loss of refrigeration
of food and medications, air conditioners, and lights.Those fortunate
enough to have generators (17.5% in Florida following hurricanes Charley,
Frances, Ivan, and Jeanne) [1] can spare some of these inconveniences, but
generators are a risk unto themselves.Standard generators run on gasoline.Spilling gasoline onto a hot engine while attempting to reﬁll the tank can
lead to a burned victim.Despite the seemingly appropriate placement of
generators away from living quarters, carbon monoxide is still a cause of
fatal and nonfatal poisonings after hurricanes.One hundred sixty-seven such
poisonings (including six fatalities) were treated in Florida in the aftermath
of the four hurricanes of the summer of 2004 [2].


fatal and nonfatal poisonings after hurricanes.One hundred sixty-seven such
poisonings (including six fatalities) were treated in Florida in the aftermath
of the four hurricanes of the summer of 2004 [2].

Although common knowl-
edge might predict otherwise, 5% of those using generators placed them
indoors [2].Fifty-one cases of carbon monoxide poisoning were reported
following Hurricane Katrina in 2005 in the states of Louisiana, Mississippi,
and Alabama.Burns resulting from alternate sources of heat for cooking,
such as barbeques and butane/propane stoves, are also frequent.Downed power lines are also a source of injury.Contact with any struc-
tures charged by these lines leads to electrocution injury.In areas ﬂooded by
the storm, those entering the water to work or play are subject to lethal elec-
trocution if that water is energized by a downed power line.549 HURRICANE DISASTER RESPONSE
Clearing and repairing the damage to one’s property can be arduous
work.As noted, hurricanes occur during the summer months when the
heat and humidity are at their highest.Many people are not accustomed
to heavy workloads in these environments and, as a result, suﬀer heat disor-
ders.Cardiac events also increase in frequency.Roof and tree damage leads
to people climbing to heights not frequented by most.Falls from roofs and
ladders are commonly seen in the aftermath of a storm.For some, only
a home remedy is required, but for others, the injury is a signiﬁcant lacera-
tion, fracture, or worse, brain injury or other form of life-threatening inter-
nal injury.The debris after a hurricane is frequently in the form of shrubbery and
fallen trees.Clearing these often requires knives, handsaws, machetes, and
chain saws.Many people rent chain saws but have little or no experience
using them.As one might imagine, a spectrum of lacerations, some quite
severe, results from the use of these tools.Preparation is key
Preparation is the key to minimizing injury and death from the destruc-
tive forces of a hurricane; however, as witnessed in the days surrounding the
approach of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita toward the cities within Louisiana
and Texas, and Hurricane Wilma in Florida during the summer of 2005,
preparation can be formidable on a public health level.


approach of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita toward the cities within Louisiana
and Texas, and Hurricane Wilma in Florida during the summer of 2005,
preparation can be formidable on a public health level.

Evacuation plans
must include those unable to evacuate themselves, including the healthy
who do not have personal transportation and the residents and patients
of nursing homes, group homes, hospices, and hospitals.Despite mandatory
evacuation orders by local oﬃcials to those in predicted high-risk areas,
a signiﬁcant percentage of these residents do not heed these orders.As a re-
sult, call volumes for prehospital providers increase markedly.Although
some patients acquire only minor injuries, many suﬀer chronic problems
and have nowhere to go.The elderly are deposited in hospital emergency
departments by family members, expecting a safe refugedall this at a time
when the hospitals themselves may be trying to evacuate.As seen during the
hurricanes of 2005, many nursing homes had evacuation plans that included
agreements with transportation companies, but because those companies
had contracted with several nursing homes simultaneously, they did not
have the capability of evacuating all of the patients in time.Hospital disaster plans usually include a plan to discharge or transfer less
acute patients to nonaﬀected facilities.Critical patients, however, are fre-
quently not able to be transferred due to their acuity, and are rightfully
left in place.Hurricanes can bring storm surges, heavy rains, and ﬂooding,
and hospitals with ground-based helipads are unable to evacuate patients by
air if those helipads are under water.Most hospitals have ground-level or
basement emergency generators that can similarly ﬂood and become nonop-
erational.Although the Joint Commission for the Accreditation of Health
550 SHATZ et al
Care Organizations requires that hospitals have fuel for those generators, no
minimum amount is speciﬁed.The American Institute of Architects guide-
lines state that hospitals should have a minimal storage capacity to permit
continuous operation for at least 24 hours [3] in accordance with National
Fire Protection Association (NFPA) 99, NFPA 101, and NFPA 110.

Flor-
ida Building Code speciﬁes a requirement for a fuel supply stored on-site to
fuel generators for 100% load for 72 hours of actual demand load for all
patient areas (Florida Building Code Section 419.4.2.9.2) for nursing homes
(Florida Building Code Section 420.3.25) and hospitals (Florida Building
Code Section 419.3.18).(NFPA 110 Section 2-2.3 requires a Class 48 gener-
ator, deﬁned as having a fuel tank size of 48 hours, with an additional 33%
over the 48 hours required as per Section 3-4.2.3.This requirement equates
to 64 hours of fuel, but for simplicity, 72 hours is the standard).What if
evacuation resources are not available until after that fuel is exhausted?Some health care facilities in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina
had accumulated a supply of food and water but had stored them in base-
ment facilities, only to have them destroyed by ﬂoodwaters [4].Even gener-
ator power can fail, leaving ventilators that lack backup batteries without
a power source and, therefore, nonoperational.The usual 1:2 ICU nurse-
to-patient ratio suddenly becomes unmanageable when ventilated patients
require human-assisted ventilation with bag-valve-masks.Special needs, hospice, nursing home, and hospitalized patients should
probably be evacuated in larger storms, but many older adults requiring
no special needs choose to remain in the area.During and after the storm,
however, barriers to medical care for pre-existing needs can prove fatal [5].Food, water, and medications can be destroyed in the storm, and isolation
because of ﬂooding or area destruction can prevent access to medical care.Because hurricanes tend to be summertime events, excessive heat can prove
to be fatal in those who have frail health.As seen in Hurricane Katrina,
even those in a normal state of health can succumb to the high temperatures
produced in attics during attempts to escape rising ﬂoodwaters.Although hospitals are on the high-priority list for restoration of support,
lower-proﬁle hospices, assisted living facilities, and skilled nursing facilities
are often delayed in regaining necessary power and supplies.


lower-proﬁle hospices, assisted living facilities, and skilled nursing facilities
are often delayed in regaining necessary power and supplies.

Outpatient di-
alysis centers are another signiﬁcant area of need.Most hospitals are not
equipped to handle a large number of chronic dialysis patients if the outpa-
tient centers should become nonfunctional.For this reason, if advance
warning is available, these patients should be dialyzed at their respective
centers before the event occurs and be prepared to not be dialyzed for up
to 3 days after; adherence to a proper emergency renal diet is necessary
[6].All Medicare-certiﬁed outpatient dialysis centers are required to have
at least one backup facility [7], and this information must be passed on to
the patients.Similar arrangements need to made for chemotherapy patients
and other chronic needs patients.Oxygen supplies for health care facilities
and those on home oxygen must also be kept current.551 HURRICANE DISASTER RESPONSE
Coordination of the poststorm medical needs response should occur
through the local and state Emergency Operations Centers.Emergency
Support Function (ESF) 8 is the designated group within the disaster
response organization responsible for this coordination and should be
updated regularly with the functional status of all health care facilities
within the aﬀected areas.These facilities include all emergency medical ser-
vices ground and air systems, bed surge capacities of hospitals, burn beds,
acute care beds, skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, and a listing of
all blood centers, dialysis centers, and outpatient chemotherapy and radia-
tion centers.Anticipation of blood needs is yet another task for hospitals.One of the
many challenges facing resumption of clinical surgical services is blood
product availability.All community-wide blood drives are usually sus-
pended, which means that all blood products need to be delivered from re-
mote locations.This delay in delivery is especially problematic for platelets,
which have a shelf life of only 5 days.Local and state disaster response
As outlined previously, hurricanes may pass into the history books as
nothing more than a stressful threat or as the most devastating natural di-
saster in United States history.The degree of poststorm response is dictated
by the degree of destruction.Area hospital emergency rooms can quickly become busy.In the early
hours and days after the storm, many of the visits are for injuries.

 the degree of destruction.Area hospital emergency rooms can quickly become busy.In the early
hours and days after the storm, many of the visits are for injuries.

In the
authors’ experience, these patients can be taken to areas of the hospital
other than the emergency room (for instance, the recovery room if elective
surgical cases are suspended) in an eﬀort to oﬄoad the increasing surge on
the emergency department.Because hospital registration is often the bottle-
neck to rapid care, wounds can be triaged and addressed ﬁrst by surgeons
brought in speciﬁcally for this reason, patients can be given a supply of an-
tibiotics, and registration can be handled as the patients exit the area.In
any large-scale disaster, medical care must be streamlined and sometimes
inventive.Medical licenses are issued by the state, which should allow personnel to
practice anywhere within that state.The limitations to outside physician and
nursing assistance, therefore, are at the individual hospital level.Emergency
suspension of the requirement of hospital privileges allows personnel from
unaﬀected areas to ﬁll positions in the hospital temporarily vacated by med-
ical personnel whose own lives have been disrupted by the storm.This
waiver allows for the reopening of hospitals and much needed medical
care in the immediate vicinity of the aﬀected area.Knowledge of the operational status of near and distant area facilities
allows for expedited transfer or transport of patients to functional medical
care facilities.Figs.1 and 2 from the Department of Health and Human
552 SHATZ et al

and national availability of medical care for hurricane victims following
Hurricane Rita in 2005.A means of rapidly assessing the needs of the
aﬀected area also allows proper resource deployment and use [8].Federal disaster assistance
In December 2004, the National Response Plan (NRP) [9] became oper-
ational, with a 4-month phase-in period, after which the previous Federal
Response Plan, the US Government Domestic Terrorism Concept of
Operations Plan, and the Federal Radiological Emergency Response Plan
became obsolete.

became obsolete.

This document, based on the National Incident Manage-
ment System, provides a framework within which disaster response can
operate at all levels (local, state, tribal, federal, private sector, and nongov-
ernmental organizations) and is designed to function in an all-hazards envi-
ronment.With this plan comes deﬁnitions of roles and responsibilities of key
authorities.Although hurricanes allow for more planning and preparation than other
natural disasters, much of the initial poststorm response lies in the hands of
local authorities who are usually ﬁrst on scene.This response includes an
initial damage assessment, the subsequent restoration of power outages,
553 HURRICANE DISASTER RESPONSE
Fig.2.Operational status of hospitals during Hurricane Rita.(From US Department of Health
and Human Services, Washington, DC.)the clearing of roads to allow the safe movement of traﬃc and rescue per-
sonnel, and the establishment of a law enforcement presence to prevent un-
lawful acts.In the event that local resources are overwhelmed, state
assistance is requested.As outlined in the NRP, the governor, as the state’s
chief executive oﬃcer, is responsible for coordinating the state’s resources
‘‘to address the full spectrum of actions to prevent, prepare for, respond
to, and recover from incidents in an all-hazards context’’ [9].If and when
it becomes clear that state assets have been exceeded or exhausted, federal
assistance can be requested by the governor.The process for this request
and assistance is outlined in the Robert T. Staﬀord Disaster Relief and As-
sistance Act [10].This federal assistance can be extensive and can include
medical care.Within the NRP are 15 ESFs.These ESFs, in their partial or full activa-
tion, provide a coordinated assistance mechanism for local, state, and tribal
governments for recovery from any and all disasters.Two of these 15 ESFs
provide medical assistance.Activation of ESF 9 (Urban Search and Rescue)

lapse.

mobilizes elite teams trained in the specialized area of heavy structure col-
lapse.

These teams provide primarily search and rescue capabilities but in-
clude a component of medical personnel for the treatment of rescued
victims; however, their supplies and capabilities are limited.Within ESF 8
(Public Health and Medical Services) is the National Disaster Medical
554 SHATZ et al
System and the network of Disaster Medical Assistance Teams (DMATs).These DMATs consist of medical personnel from all areas of emergency
medical care, including physicians, nurses, radiology and respiratory ther-
apy technicians, and laboratory personnel.These teams deploy with their
personnel and equipment and are capable of independent function as a ﬁeld
hospital in a parking lot or in ﬁlling personnel positions in existing hospitals.These teams were used extensively in the hurricanes of 2004 and especially
in those of 2005.Over 64,000 patients were treated by the deployed DMAT
teams in the 6 weeks following the landfall of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita
in 2005 [11].Military assets have also been successfully deployed following
major storms [12] and can provide supplies, air support, manpower, and law
enforcement resources.The future
Every disaster carries with it new challenges that have never been seen or
perhaps never been considered.As such, every disaster provides a teaching
environment from which we can and should learn.Hurricane Katrina pro-
vided a signiﬁcant classroom from which we can change future policy.Few disasters in the United States have brought the infrastructure of an
entire city to its knees as occurred in New Orleans in the summer of 2005.Few have produced the numbers of victims of that storm.A considerable
amount of time and brainpower has been devoted over the years to preparing
for disasters, but more postincident planning should be stressed.Although
communication has long been a recognized problem in the postdisaster set-
ting, transportation becomes a formidable issue in a large-scale disaster
that aﬀects thousands and eliminates the basic support structures.Before
and after a storm, huge numbers of people must be evacuated by public
and private transportation.Even those who heed evacuation demands ﬁnd
themselves caught in interminable traﬃc jams.Eﬀective plans that allow
for proper evacuation must be developed, and adequate numbers of vehicles
used for postevent evacuation must be rapidly mobilized.

Eﬀective plans that allow
for proper evacuation must be developed, and adequate numbers of vehicles
used for postevent evacuation must be rapidly mobilized.

After victims are removed from immediate danger, they are frequently
deposited in areas while awaiting deﬁnitive evacuation.Mass care of these
potential thousands must be prepared for.Casualty collection points must
be identiﬁed before the event and must be staﬀed and equipped properly
with basic-needs medical care.These collection points can range in function
from treatment areas to morgues.Mass casualty triage must be used eﬀec-
tively.Although most physicians are accustomed to treating the most severely
sick and injured ﬁrst, it is diﬃcult for this practice to happen in these settings.Those in need of advanced medical care may fall into triage categories in
which care will not be rendered, and physicians must be trained to deal with
this scenario.Shelters should be identiﬁed for prestorm evacuees and the
potential hundreds or thousands displaced from their homes after the storm.555 HURRICANE DISASTER RESPONSE
Summary
The preparation and rebuilding in the wake of a devastating hurricane
can be a challenge at all levels.The summer of 2004 proved how frequently
these preparations might need to happen, and the hurricanes of 2005 dem-
onstrated how extensive these preparations should be and the cost of inad-
equate preparation.Medical care is a very large component of the disaster
plan for hurricanes and must include not only supplies but also personnel.Personal and professional limitations can impede the response of valuable
personnel to distant sites, but one must remember that the local response
falls in the hands of those ﬁrst on site (ie, those who reside in the area).Proper planning and eﬀective drills can mitigate the extent of damage to
structures and human life, and when deemed necessary, eﬀective evacuation
of at-risk areas is crucial.In the end, nature is much too powerful a force for
us to ﬁghtdwe can only be prepared to respond to and bend with the po-
tentially devastating forces directed our way.References

Disaster Preparedness Guide for Caregivers
1INTRODUCTION
As a family caregiver, you are one of 53 million Americans caring for someone older, ill, or disabled.In many
cases, you may be the only one attending to the daily needs of an elderly parent, disabled neighbor, or medically complex child.Those in your care depend on you for their safety and well-being—especially during emergencies.In recognition of your unparalleled dedication and commitment to those in your care, the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA.gov) and the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers (RCI) (rosalynncarter.org) have
created this Disaster Preparedness Guide for Caregivers to help you navigate the unique challenges that may
arise when disasters strike.Caregivers navigate complex systems and plan for the unexpected every day.In preparing for a disaster, you will
use all this experience!You are already further along in your preparedness journey than you might think.This guide will help you learn about disaster preparedness and identify the needs of your care recipient and how they might change during a disaster.You may also have questions about preparedness or not even know the questions to ask.This guide will help answer these questions, share ways to connect with your community, and bolster your confidence as a caregiver during a disaster.Not all caregiving experiences are the same, and the information and resources in the guide reflect this.Before
you start, think about your unique circumstances: Are you a caregiver who will prepare with your care recipient?Are you a caregiver with a support network to help prepare your care recipient?Are you a solo caregiver starting from scratch?This guide provides tailored information and resources to support you as a caregiver no matter your situation.2
STEP 1  | IDENTIFY BARRIERS AND RISKS
This step identifies common challenges you face as a family caregiver and strategies for overcoming them—
either with your care recipient, with your support network, or as a solo caregiver.It will also enable you to
understand the various obstacles you may face when getting your care recipient ready for a disaster—including mobility issues, limited resources, and medical needs.In this section, you will find ways to build resilience for yourself and those in your care.

 ready for a disaster—including mobility issues, limited resources, and medical needs.In this section, you will find ways to build resilience for yourself and those in your care.

STEP 2  | LEARN AND CONNECT
This step guides y
ou in establishing partnerships with emergency services and identifying community
resources you will use to make your plan.You can learn and connect with your care recipient or with your support network.If you are a solo caregiver, now is the time to start making connections and finding support.Through these tips, you can strengthen your community ties and ensure support and resources are readily available when you need them.STEP 3  | MAKE A PLAN
In this step, y
ou will learn the essential aspects of preparedness and how to develop a comprehensive emergency
plan, including building a disaster preparedness kit.Part of making a plan is empowering your care recipient in their disaster preparedness planning or engaging your support network.If you don’t have a support network, now is the time to start making those connections that will benefit you both today and during a disaster.3STEP 1
Identify Barriers and Risks
With Your Care Recipient With Your Support Network Solo Caregiver
Consider your circumstances and find information and resources to meet your unique needs throughout the guide.As a family caregiver, you are used to handling the unexpected.You know that circumstances can change quickly
and that plans need to adjust based on the needs of your care recipient—sometimes day-to-day and sometimes
hour-by-hour.You have learned how to navigate complex systems to help your care recipient lead a fulfilling and meaningful life.All of your experience as a caregiver will help you prepare your care recipient for disasters and emergencies.Caregivers and their support networks have a window into the world of their care recipients.Yet often, it is easy to miss some specific barriers they may face.Understanding your care recipient’s unique risks is vital in personalizing a comprehensive disaster preparedness plan.Step 1 of this guide focuses on identifying barriers and risks, provides insights that will help you overcome
challenges, and, most importantly, gives you the tools to build resilience for yourself and your care recipients.With Your Care Recipient:
• How do you best understand and respond to information?• How do you communicate your needs to others?How does this change in stressful  or unfamiliar situations?• What help do you require for personal care?• What assistive technology do you use to meet your daily activity needs?• Do you have the money to cover expenses such as relocation, extra medications,  or other associated costs you may encounter in a disaster?

• What helps you adjust to new or unfamiliar people and places?• What methods of transportation do you rely on?• How do you communicate pain or when you are subjected to extreme temperatures?With Your Support Network:
• How does my care recipient communicate their needs to others?• Does my care recipient use assistive devices, interpreters for communication, or speak a language not common in the community?Is my support network familiar with these communication needs and know how to address them?• How do I inform first responders or emergency response personnel about the unique communication needs of my care recipient?4• Does my care recipient use medical equipment that requires electricity?• How does my care recipient report pain or indicate when they are subjected to extreme temperatures?• Do members of my support team have a full understanding of the medication and equipment needs of the
person I am taking care of?• Does the person I am caring for depend on other providers or medical services for extended care?Does my support network know how to access this care?• What is the role of my support network in helping my care recipient accomplish activities such as grocery shopping and paying bills?• What medications or assistive devices enable my care recipient to function independently?Does my support network know how to use this technology or administer these medications?• Does my care recipient engage in self-harming behaviors, and how can my support network help me identify strategies to keep my care recipient safe?Solo Caregiver:
• Do I fully understand the medication and equipment needs of the person I am taking care of?• What are the most pressing concerns I have when my care recipient is without their typical  level of supervision?• What are my limitations as a solo caregiver?• Do I know how to assist my care recipient with finding resources to meet expenses during or after a disaster?• Do I know who provides medical care and how to access this care during a disaster?5STEP 2
Learn and Connect
With Your Care Recipient With Your Support Network Solo Caregiver
Consider your circumstances and find information and resources to meet your unique needs throughout the guide.Now that you have taken some time to assess the barriers, risks, and needs that your care recipient may
face, step 2 will help you assess preparedness roles, learn about resources to meet these needs, and provide guidance on fostering a collaborative approach to preparedness.

 learn about resources to meet these needs, and provide guidance on fostering a collaborative approach to preparedness.

If you are a solo caregiver, now is the time to start building connections to create a support network that will allow you and your care recipient to be resilient in the face of barriers and risks you encounter.ASSESS PREPAREDNESS ROLES
With Your Care Recipient:
Engaging your care recipient, if they are able to do so, is a crucial step in emergency preparedness.Below are some conversation starters to engage your care recipient in a discussion about preparedness activities.• “I’d like to talk about disaster preparedness and what that means to me and you.”
• “When preparing for a disaster, I see my role as ________________.What do you see your role as?”
• “I would like to talk about our activities for disaster preparedness.Would you like to engage  in disaster preparedness activities?”
With Your Support Network:
Engage your support network, along with involving your care recipient, to ensure that emergency preparedness planning becomes a team effort.Below are some conversation starters to engage your support network in a discussion about preparedness activities.• “I would like to talk about disaster preparedness and how we can work together to ensure [name] is prepared in the event of an emergency.”
• “As a close family member, friend, or medical provider of [name], could you provide any additional considerations that I should be aware of as I help [name] get prepared?”
• “What resources of yours can I leverage to ensure myself and my care recipient are prepared?”
6Solo Caregiver:
As a solo caregiver, it might be difficult to figure out where to start in preparing yourself and your care recipient
for a disaster.Below are some questions you can ask yourself as a solo caregiver to get started in your preparedness journey.• “What barriers to preparedness may I or my care recipient face?”
• “What additional help do I need to ensure that I and my care recipient are prepared?”
• “Are there additional ways I can get involved in emergency preparedness or get connected to emergency management professionals?”
DISASTER PREPAREDNESS RESOURCES FOR CAREGIVERS
While many resources are available to support your preparedness journey, knowing where to look to help you create your unique preparedness plan can be hard.

TER PREPAREDNESS RESOURCES FOR CAREGIVERS
While many resources are available to support your preparedness journey, knowing where to look to help you create your unique preparedness plan can be hard.

While it can feel overwhelming, you might be further along than you think—all of the ways you navigate medical systems, maintain schedules, and meet the needs of your care recipient will help you as you plan for a disaster.Medications, prescription refills, medical care: For many caregivers and care recipients, the daily
stress of prescription refills and managing medication schedules becomes even more urgent and complicated
in a disaster situation.While there may not be an easy answer, there are programs and resources you can
leverage in times of disaster.Learn about these resources before you need them, talk to your care recipient’s doctor and support network, and know that doing the work now will help alleviate stress should you ever need this information.• Emergency prescription laws: Each state has different laws that authorize pharmacies and pharmacists to refill prescriptions early in the event of a declared emergency.Familiarize yourself with the laws in your state by visiting: Healthcare Ready’s A Review of State
Emergency Prescription Protocols (healthcareready.org/a-review-of-state-emergency-prescription-protocols/) and CDC’s A Prescription for Preparedness (blogs.cdc.gov/publichealthmatters/2019/09/prescription-preparedness/) .• Locate an open pharmacy or healthcare facility during and after a disaster: If your care recipient relies on medication or routine medical treatments, knowing how to find a pharmacy or facility after a disaster is important.Healthcare Ready’s Rx Open (rxopen.org) provides information on the operating status of healthcare facilities in areas impacted by a disaster.If you require specialty or compounded medications, make a list of these pharmacies along your evacuation route.7• Home medical equipment, adaptative equipment, assistive technology, and durable medical
equipment: If your care recipient has specialized equipment or devices, include these in your preparedness planning, and know that there are options to replace or get support if needed after a disaster.• Replace assistive technology and durable medical equipment: Pass It On Center is a national resource to reuse assistive technology and durable medical equipment.For additional information or to find a program near you, search the database here: Pass It On Center Find Reuse Locations (pioc.gatech.edu/pioc/
reuse_locations.php) .

 Find Reuse Locations (pioc.gatech.edu/pioc/
reuse_locations.php) .

• Replace medicine and equipment if you don’t have insurance: The Emergency Prescription Assistance Program (EPAP) helps people in a federally identified disaster area who do not have health insurance to get the prescription drugs, vaccinations, medical supplies, and equipment they need.Review covered items and learn more about this program here: The Emergency Prescription Assistance Program
(aspr.hhs.gov/EPAP/Pages/default.aspx) .Power restoration: If your care recipient relies on electricity for medical devices, assistive technology, or to maintain health and independence, your electricity supplier may have programs or resources to help.Ask how to get on a priority restoration list or if they can provide battery backups to individuals with a qualifying need and diagnosis.When you start to make your plan, identify people in your support network who may be outside the affected area if there is a loss of electricity and you need to evacuate.Transportation: When engaging in preparedness planning, it is important to consider the transportation needs
of your care recipient—particularly if an evacuation is necessary.Your local Area Agency on Aging is one resource that can connect you to information about transportation options and in-home care support.• The Eldercare Locator (eldercare.acl.gov/Public/Resources/Topic/Caregiver.aspx) can help you identify transportation resources before a disaster and help you plan for a disaster or emergency.Respite care: As a family caregiver, you know you can’t go it alone—and you don’t have to.When you
need help, and you will, there are resources to locate respite care in your community that you can consider as you prepare.• The National Respite Network and Resource Center (archrespite.org/caregiver-resources/respitelocator/) can help you locate respite service providers in your community.Respite providers can be an important part of your support network.Additional resources: Every caregiver and their care recipient have different needs, barriers, and challenges to overcome.And even after reviewing the resources in this guide, you may still have questions.• Aging and Disability Resource Centers (acl.gov/programs/aging-and-disability-networks/aging-and-disability-resource-centers) can help caregivers connect to services and supports.

LEARN ABOUT DISASTERS AND EMERGENCIES YOU MIGHT FACE
Just like the care you provide is unique, so are the impacts of a disaster on yourself and
your care recipient.It’s important to get familiarized with disasters that may happen and to think about the possible effects on your care recipient and yourself.Learn about disasters and hazards in your area and how to prepare through FEMA’s Ready.gov Hazard Information Sheets (ready.gov/be-informed)  and Healthcare Ready’s Disaster Disaster Tip
Sheets (healthcareready.org/disaster-tip-sheets/).ESTABLISHING PARTNERSHIPS WITH EMERGENCY SERVICES
As a family caregiver, you need to be aware of and communicate your needs to those in your community charged with keeping you safe.It is essential to form relationships ahead of time with emergency services personnel and community organizations who can connect you to accessible resources and help you understand your options during an emergency.And if you are a solo caregiver, you know you can’t go it alone, so now is the time to build a support network.With Your Care Recipient:
• Find out how emergency management officials communicate with your community in an emergency.• Identify the communications channels to access in a disaster.• Sign yourself and your care recipients up for emergency alerts (ready.gov/alerts).-The National Weather Service broadcasts weather and emergency warnings specific to your community.You can purchase a special receiver (weather.gov/nwr/nwr_receivers) to access these alerts.-The FEMA App (ready.gov/fema-app) allows you to receive real-time weather and emergency alerts, send   notifications to loved ones, locate emergency shelters in your area, get preparedness  strategies,  and more.• Attend community preparedness fairs or fire station open houses with your care recipient to meet and connect with first responders.• Discover how to get transportation services if necessary.Ask your care recipient about their transportation preferences.With Your Support Network:
• Join or contact your local Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) to gain community-specific insights and valuable skills to help you and your care recipient prepare.

Solo Caregiver:
• Identify the help that you need with day-to-day caregiving activities, such as helping pick up medications or
doing laundry, and start to communicate those needs to those in your life.• Find networks to lean on for support before, during, and after a disaster.• Attend community preparedness fairs or fire station open houses to meet and connect with first responders.• Discover how to get transportation services if necessary.Think about how you access transportation now, and how that might change in a disaster.• Sign yourself up for emergency alerts (ready.gov/alerts).-The National Weather Service broadcasts weather and emergency warnings specific to your community.You can purchase a special receiver (weather.gov/nwr/nwr_receivers) to access these alerts.-The FEMA App (ready.gov/fema-app) allows you to receive real-time weather and emergency alerts, locate emergency shelters in your area, get preparedness strategies, and more.• Identify the communications channels you can access in a disaster.UNDERSTANDING THE CRITICAL ROLE
OF FAMILY CAREGIVERS
In 2018, Hurricane Florence forced our family into crisis decision making mode.As the storm barreled toward the North Carolina coast, my grandmother’s facility called to encourage my mom to take her before we evacuated.If we didn’t, they were going to place memory care residents across the state.For the first time, our caregiver stress was compounded with the stress of a
disaster.Every option would likely increase her confusion and agitation.In the end, we decided to take her with us.This experience illustrated how much our systems aren’t designed to support caregivers during disasters—or
a pandemic.

 option would likely increase her confusion and agitation.In the end, we decided to take her with us.This experience illustrated how much our systems aren’t designed to support caregivers during disasters—or
a pandemic.

My mom and I talk often about how we would have managed caregiving during
this pandemic, living in fear of not cleaning a surface properly or forgetting to wash grandma’s hands or ours.Would we have allowed home health workers into the house?After all, they provide respite for so many, and do essential medical tasks, not to mention they help reduce isolation.But is the risk to the household, or the risk to the worker, worth it?Understanding the critical and irreplaceable role family caregivers of all ages
play—that they too are on the front-line of care and need our support—will be key to effectively navigating future disasters.-Dr. Jennifer Olsen, Chief Executive Officer, Rosalynn Carter Institute for Caregivers
STEP 3
Make A Plan
With Your Care Recipient With Your Support Network Solo Caregiver
Consider your circumstances and find information and resources to meet your unique needs throughout the guide.Now that you have done a thorough risk assessment and identified the resources available to you
and your care recipient, you are ready to make a disaster emergency plan.This includes building a disaster
preparedness kit and preparing for evacuation or disaster sheltering scenarios.While planning, you will want to include your care recipient, when possible, as well as family and friends and any support networks you have developed.Be honest and open about the process and the role you are willing to play.With Your Care Recipient:
One important thing to remember when preparing as a caregiver is that you cannot do it all by yourself.So, it is important to look at preparedness not only through the limitations the person you care for has but also to look at what can they do to help in preparing.Think through preparedness tasks that your care recipient can do.These tasks should fit within your care recipient’s abilities and should not add additional stress or anxiety to either you or your care recipient.Including your care recipient in the preparedness process will let them see that they are valued in this relationship and they, too, can play an important role in disaster preparedness.10• Engage in a conversation with your care recipient to understand their abilities and limitations.This collaborative approach can make disaster preparedness a team effort.• Discuss roles and responsibilities during disasters and ensure your care recipient feels included in the process.• Identify tasks your care recipient can handle, such as checking food expiration dates or ensuring equipment is functioning correctly.

Make a Plan With
With Your Support Network:
Work with your support network and make a plan for your care recipient during a disaster.Consider
the strengths, abilities, and strategies that are unique to your situation and your care recipient.Care Recipient’s Strengths
and AbilitiesStrategies to Maintain Strengths and Abilities in an Emergency
CommunicationExample: Visual images help care recipient
understand and process information.Example: A picture board could help communication.Medical Needs Example: Daily prescription medications.Example: List of prescriptions and a list of specialty pharmacies in case of evacuation.IndependenceExample: Is accompanied to the store and on errands with a caregiver or family member.Example: Knows how to contact caregiver or family member.SupervisionExample: Uses a visual schedule to adapt to routine changes and ease anxiety.Example: Visual schedule is updated in case of evacuation to a shelter.TransportationExample: The care recipient needs a wheelchair-accessible van.Example: Identify back-up transportation services if the regular service provider cannot assist during an emergency.11
12
 Solo Caregiver:
As a solo caregiver, preparing for a disaster rests with you.This can be overwhelming, but there are strategies to
help you get started.• Identify preparedness activities you can integrate into your daily routine, such as calming techniques to adjust to new environments or practicing your evacuation route on your way to routine appointments.• Recognize that as a caregiver, you have handled emergencies before.Look for the lessons learned from those experiences and apply it to your preparedness planning.• Divide preparedness actions into smaller steps.An example can be creating a kit over time instead of all
at once.• Ask trusted individuals in your life what their preparedness plan is.You may learn something new, or this can be the start of your support network.• If your care recipient undergoes routine treatments from a clinic or hospital, find out their emergency plans and ask about backup service providers.PREPARE YOUR SERVICE ANIMALS
If your care recipient has a service animal, make sure to also include items such as food, water, medications, and identification for the animal in the emergency kit.For more information on preparing service animals for disasters, visit ready.gov/pets.In an emergency, a service animal must be allowed to come inside a shelter, clinic, or any other
facility related to the emergency with their owners.

 for disasters, visit ready.gov/pets.In an emergency, a service animal must be allowed to come inside a shelter, clinic, or any other
facility related to the emergency with their owners.

If you have a pet and cannot bring them with you, make sure to plan for who will care for your pet if you leave your home.13BUILD A KIT
Building an emergency kit is an essential step in preparedness.Start with the resources on Ready.gov to make
a communications plan (ready.gov/plan-form)  and build your emergency kit (ready.gov/kit) .Then, use the
checklist below to help you addresses the unique needs of your care recipient.PREPAREDNESS KIT CHECKLIST FOR CARE RECIPIENTS

DURING A DISASTER
MAKE A PLAN TO LEAVE
As a caregiver, it is essential to be prepared for evacuation scenarios.

In some disaster situations, leaving your
current location for a safer location is the best course of action for you and your care recipient.With Your Care Recipient:
• Planning your evacuation route ahead of time is crucial.Practice this route with your care recipient to reduce uncertainty and stress.• Involve your care recipient in the process.Research and identify the best route together and update it as circumstances change.• If your care recipient cannot accompany you, show them how to plan a route on a map or using pictures.• Identify a meet up spot and an alternative contact in case you get separated from your care recipient.With Your Support Network:
• Collaborate with your support network to identify evacuation routes that suit your care recipient’s needs.This could mean evacuating to a friend or family member who can provide suitable accommodations.Or this may
look like evacuating to a friend in a nearby town who has a backup generator or a family member in another
state whose home is accessible for your care recipient and their needs.• If needed, identify a place to stay that will accept pets.Most public shelters allow only service animals.• Discuss roles and responsibilities during an evacuation, considering the barriers members of your support network might face.Solo Caregiver:
• Consult with local emergency management officials for advice on the best evacuation route that considers your caregiver role.• Plan and practice your evacuation route.• Honestly assess your capacity and make an evacuation plan that is reasonable for you.For more information on evacuation planning,
visit ready.gov/evacuation .15MAKE AN EMERGENCY SHELTERING PLAN
In some situations, you may need to take your care recipient to a local/community shelter.Emergency sheltering,
also known as congregant sheltering, is an unfamiliar situation to most people.Knowing what to expect will
help you develop a plan that meets the unique needs of your care recipient.There are some important things to
consider about emergency or congregate sheltering:
• Understand that a congregate shelter is a facility designed to provide safety and security for a large number of people during disasters.These facilities could be churches or convention centers in non-disaster times.• Congregate shelters mean that you and your care recipient will be sharing living spaces, restrooms, and showers with other people in your community.With Your Care Recipient:
• Discuss with your care recipient any accommodations that could make the sheltering experience more comfortable.

 your care recipient will be sharing living spaces, restrooms, and showers with other people in your community.With Your Care Recipient:
• Discuss with your care recipient any accommodations that could make the sheltering experience more comfortable.

Share these with shelter authorities.• Schedule a meeting with your local emergency management office to determine the locations of your designated congregate shelter and possibly arrange a tour with your care recipient.• Download the FEMA App  for a list of open shelters during an active disaster in your local area.• Work with your care recipient to pack and bring a well-prepared kit for yourself, your care recipient, and any service animals, if needed.With Your Support Network:
• Engage your support network to identify which congregate sheltering locations you, your care recipient, and your support network will use during a disaster.• With your support network, identify which accommodations your care recipient may need at a congregate shelter and communicate these to shelter authorities.• Plan how to receive updates and communicate with your support network, especially if you are sheltering in a different location.Solo Caregiver:
• Discuss your caregiver role with the shelter authorities to see if there are quieter spaces or accommodations that can make the experience more comfortable.• Schedule a meeting with your local emergency management office to determine the locations of your designated congregate shelter and possibly arrange a tour.-Download the FEMA App  for a list of open shelters during an active disaster in your local area.• Ensure you bring a well-prepared kit for both yourself and your care recipient (and your service animal,
if needed).• Familiarize yourself with the shelter’s rules and regulations to know what comfort items you
can bring.16MAKE A PLAN TO STAY INSIDE
Sometimes the best way to stay safe in an emergency is to get inside and stay inside a building or vehicle until
danger has passed.This is also known as sheltering in place and there are ways to prepare for this possibility.With Your Care Recipient:
• With your care recipient, identify the safest place to seek shelter based on the disasters you may face.• Together, ensure the room or area you are in has an emergency kit, as it may not be safe to move during an active disaster.• Considering the potential stress of sheltering in place with your care recipient, identify comfort items and stress management strategies.• Plan how to receive updates and communicate them to your care recipient, remaining reassuring and calm.• If there is electricity, keep phones and communication and medical devices fully charged.With Your Support Network:
• Engage your support network to help you identify the safest place to seek shelter during a disaster.

• If there is electricity, keep phones and communication and medical devices fully charged.With Your Support Network:
• Engage your support network to help you identify the safest place to seek shelter during a disaster.

• With your support network, discuss the impacts and challenges of being alone with your care recipient.Prepare your safe space with the necessary supplies.• Build an emergency kit and store it in the safe space you have identified with your support network.• Plan how to receive updates and communicate with your support network.• If there is electricity, keep medical devices fully charged, as well as phones and communication devices so you can stay in contact with your support network.Solo Caregiver:
• Identify the safest place to seek shelter knowing the disasters you may face.• Ensure the room or area you are in has an emergency kit, as it may not be safe to move during an
active disaster.• Consider the potential stress of sheltering in place and with your care recipient and identify comfort items and stress management strategies to support you and your care recipient during this time.• Learn how to receive updates from local emergency management officials.• If there is electricity, keep phones and communication and medical devices fully charged.For more information on sheltering in place, including guidance for 10 different types of hazards, visit
FEMA’s Shelter-in-Place Pictogram  (www.fema.gov/sites/
default/files/documents/fema_shelter-in-place_guidance.pdf) .17One resource you can use during a disaster is  Healthcare Ready’s Alert Hub (healthcareready.org/alert-hub/).This tool provides situation reports, important contact information for
government resources, trusted communications, and disaster response information.Use this
information to make informed decisions during a disaster to minimize the impacts of the event
on your care recipient.
