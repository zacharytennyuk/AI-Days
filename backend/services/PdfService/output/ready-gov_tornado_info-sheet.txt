BE PREPARED FOR A
TORNADO
FEMA V-1010/March 2018Tornadoes can
destroy buildings,
flip cars, and create
deadly flying debris.
Tornadoes are
violently rotating
columns of air
that extend from
a thunderstorm
to the ground. Can happen anytime Bring intense winds Can happen anywhere Look like funnels
IF YOU ARE UNDER A TORNADO WARNING,
FIND SAFE SHELTER RIGHT AWAY
Go to a safe room,
basement, or storm cellar.
If there is no basement,
get to a small, interior room
on the lowest level.
Stay away from windows,
doors, and outside walls.If you can safely get to a sturdy
building, do so immediately.
Do not get under an overpas or
bridge. You’re safer in a low, flat
location.
Watch out for flying debris that
can cause injury or death.
Use your arms to protect your head and neck.1

HOW TO STAY SAFE
WHEN A TORNADO THREATENS
Prepare
NOW
Know your area’s tornado risk. In the
U.S., the Midwest and the Southeast
have a greater risk for tornadoes.
Know the signs of a tornado ,
including a rotating funnel-shaped
cloud, an approaching cloud of
debris, or a loud roar—similar to a
freight train.
Sign up for your community’s
warning system. The Emergency
Alert System (EAS) and National
Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) Weather
Radio also provide emergency alerts.
If your community has sirens, become
familiar with the warning tone.
Pay attention to weather reports.
Meteorologists can predict when
conditions might be right for
a tornado.
Identify and practice going to a
safe shelter  for high winds, such as a
safe room built using FEMA criteria
or a storm shelter built to ICC 500
standards.

The next best protection is
a small, interior, windowless room in a
sturdy building on the lowest level.
Consider constructing a safe
room that meets FEMA or
ICC 500 standards.Survive
DURING
Immediately go to a safe location
that you identified.
Take additional cover  by shielding
your head and neck with your
arms and putting materials such as
furniture and blankets around you.
Listen to EAS, NOAA Weather
Radio,  or local alerting systems for
current emergency information and
instructions.
Do not try to outrun a tornado in
a vehicle.
If you are in a car or outdoors and
cannot get to a building, cover your
head and neck with your arms and
cover your body with a coat or
blanket, if possible.Be Safe
AFTER
Keep listening to EAS, NOAA
Weather Radio,  and local authorities
for updated information.
If you are trapped, cover your
mouth with a cloth or mask to avoid
breathing dust. Try to send a text,
bang on a pipe or wall, or use a
whistle instead of shouting.
Stay clear of fallen power lines or
broken utility lines.
Do not enter damaged buildings  until
you are told that they are safe.
Save your phone calls for
emergencies. Phone systems are
often down or busy after a disaster.
Use text messaging or social media to
communicate with family and friends.
Be careful during clean-up. Wear
thick-soled shoes, long pants, and
work gloves.
