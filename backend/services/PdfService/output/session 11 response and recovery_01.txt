General Requirements:
The session involves discussion of  both earthquake response and r ecovery operations. Objectives
11.1 – 11.6 cover the topic of response , and Objectives 11.7 - 11.10 discuss recovery  activities.
The concept of disaster respons e and recovery already has been  introduced to the student in
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-3 earlier discussions, especially in  Session 8 where the four disast er phases were presented in a
general manner. The instructor should repeat th is and explain that this session will focus on
issues associated specifically with earthquake disasters . There also will be overlap with other
sessions, e.g., Session 7, in which earthquakes e ffects were discussed, and we saw that key
lifelines, such as major transportation routes, were likely be damaged, even in moderate earthquakes. Such disruption obviously will pose  severe impediments to both response and
recovery operations.

This session also will ove rlap with Session 14, which will cover earthquake
planning, as planning is involved with all phases and aspects of  earthquake disasters. Such
overlap is purposeful and advantageous in that  the most important issues hopefully will be re-
emphasized. The students should be encouraged to make the connections among the various
sessions and discuss them. The instructor should begin this session by defining and discussing earthquake disaster
response . It is important to discuss differences be tween response to earthquake disasters and
other hazards, such as floods or hurricanes (i .e., earthquakes occur with no warning). The
instructor should present key i ssues that promote improved disa ster response and, conversely,
discuss major challenges and impediments to re sponse. A classroom discussion assignment is
included and should be handed out  following the end of the discussion of earthquake response
(Objective 11.6). The assignment i nvolves a role-playing exercise to be completed by teams of
students in which they will be required to c onsider actions and issues faced by emergency
managers. Following the discussion on disaster response, the lecture should transition to earthquake disaster
recovery, beginning with Objectiv e 11.7. The general approach used to discuss earthquake
response should be used to presen t earthquake recovery. That is, earthquake disaster recovery
should be defined, and then key issues, impedime nts, and deficiencies presented and discussed.
A homework assignment is included and should be  distributed at the e nd of the session. One
week should be allowed for completion. Electronic visual images presente d in these notes are
included in the accompanying file: Session 11 Electronic Visuals.ppt. _____________________________________________________________________________
Objective 11.1 Define disaster response and de scribe the ways which earthquake disaster
response is unique from response to other disasters. Requirements:
The content should be presented as lecture.
Remarks:  I.

Disaster response  activities are actions taken duri ng and immediately after disaster
impact, and are designed to protect life and property and control secondary earthquake hazards (e.g., earthquake-induced fires and hazardous materials spills).
These actions begin with the warning of an  oncoming threatening event or with the
event itself if it occurs wi thout warning (i.e., most earthquakes provide no warning).
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-4
A. Disaster response activi ties typically include:
[Instructor note : The following categories will be cover ed and discussed in detail during
the in-class discussion assi gnment to be covered at the end of Objective 11.6 ]
1. Rapid damage assessment. 2. Search and rescue. 3. Emergency medical care. 4. Emergency restoration of essential services. 5. Fire-fighting. 6. Emergency communications. 7. Crisis decision-making. 8. Evacuation, protection of lives and property. 9. The provision of emergency shelter for victims. 10. Debris removal (also asso ciated with recovery).
11. Other activities that take place during the immediate post-impact
emergency period.
 B. Disaster response also includes the implementation of disaster preparedness
plans and procedures , thus overlapping with disaster preparedness .
C. Response activities must address the need to deal with both event-generated
demands  (i.e., problems directly created by th e disaster agent itself, such as
injuries and physical damage) and response-generated challenges  (i.e., the need
for rapid situation assessment and for information on which to base decisions; MCEER, 2000).
II. The federal government, all states, and virt ually all communities in the United States
have plans for responding to major disasters , including earthquakes, although both
the quality of these planning efforts and th e demonstrated capacity to respond to
major disasters varies considerably nationwide.
A. Because major disasters, such as a ca tastrophic earthquake in an urban area,
initially overwhelm available resources , perhaps the most significant challenge
facing affected communities in the imme diate post-impact period is accurate
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-5 assessment of the situation and priori tization of response needs (MCEER,
2000).
B.

A primary difference between responding to earthquake  events and other natural
disasters is that  earthquakes occur without warning and tend to affect a
widespread area even if the event is  moderate. Also, earthquakes affect
above- and below- ground lifelines, a nd buried utilities and communication
systems are more likely to be damaged during these events.
III. Fast, reliable damage assessment during earthqu akes is vital, but is extremely difficult,
particularly in large disaster earthquakes , as summarized in the following excerpt
from MCEER’s Strategic Plan (2000):
In the 1995 Kobe earthquake, for example, the response was delayed and significant
problems developed due to government’s inab ility to evaluate the scope and severity
of earthquake impacts and to mobilize resources. The same kinds of problems
occurred in the United States following Hurricane Andrew in 1992, when government
officials lacked timely, accurate data on the extent and location of damage, and as a
result, were slow to recogni ze the hurricane’s near-catastrophic effects. Such problems
could have been overcome had there been systems in place to rapidly detect damage and disruption on both macro and micro s cales while surmounting the enormous
communications and transporta tion disruptions those disast ers produced (MCEER, 2000).
Such systems currently do not exist,  either in the US or elsewhere. To avoid repeating
these experiences in the next major nation al disaster, advanced damage-detection
methods are needed, and data on damage and other impacts must be incorporated into effective crisis decision support systems.
A. Thus, early warning systems  (such as TriNet and ShakeMaps used for early
warning as discussed previously in Se ssion 6) and damage assessment/prediction
tools (GPS, GIS mapping systems) that predict and illustrate probable
damages from a number of disaster s cenarios are critically important.
B.

One key to enhancing the effectivene ss of response and recovery activities is
promoting the adoption and use of technologies e.g., remote-sensing
technologies for rapid post-event damage assessment and loss estimation) that
would enable the organizations responsib le for coordinating those activities
to deal with earthquake-related proble ms in a timely manner and to make
decisions that are based on empirical data and sound management principles
(MCEER, 2000).
Objective 11.2 List the ge neral objectives of eart hquake emergency response.
Requirements:
The content should be presented as lecture.
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-6 Remarks:
I. To ensure the survival of the maximum number of victims , keep them in the best
possible health in the circumstances. Se arch and rescue operations in collapsed
buildings is a particularly difficult cha llenge, especially in less developed areas
where there is less machinery and rescue equipment.
II. Reestablish self-sufficiency and essen tial services as quickly as possible  for all
population groups, with special attention to  those whose needs are greatest, the most
vulnerable and underprivileged. The continued operation of critical facilities (i.e.,
hospitals, emergency centers, water treatment  facilities, air traffic control towers,
etc.) and restoration of lifelines are essential  (MCEER, 2000; NRC, 2003).
III. Inspection and condemnation of damaged infrastructure (especially unstable
structures that may be dangerous due to  aftershocks) and emergency/temporary
repairs should be made where feasible.
IV. In cases involving population displacements an d temporary housing, the aim is to find
durable solutions as quickly as possible , while ensuring protection and assistance as
necessary in the meantime.
V. Accomplish all of the abo ve in a “sustainable” manner  that contributes to long-term
development goals and reduces vulnerability  to future damaging earthquakes or
other hazards.
Objective 11.3 Identify specifi c activities associated with  earthquake emergency response.
Requirements:
The content should be presented as lecture.
Remarks:
I.

Specific  activities associated with earthquake emergency response:
 [Note: The portion of the following was adapted from the Church World Service
Emergency Response Training Course Manual (CWT/ACT, 2004)]
A. Early Warning – Early warning  refers to arrangements to rapidly disseminate
information concerning imminent eart hquake motion threats to government
officials, institutions, and the population at  large in the areas at immediate risk.
These warnings normally are generated by new systems such as TriNet, discussed in Session 6. While the warning system s only begin when earthquake shaking
starts, it may allow actions such as moving to safer locations or shutting off of gas
lines, etc. as the earthquake begins.
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-7 B. Evacuation/migration – Evacuation involves the relo cation of a population from
zones at risk of an imminent  disaster to a safer location, especially if structures are
susceptible to damage from aftershock.
C. Search and rescue – Search and rescue (SAR), is the process of identifying the
location of disaster victims who may be tr apped or isolated and bringing them to
safety and medical attention. In the aftermath of earthquakes, SAR normally
focuses on locating people who are trappe d and injured in collapsed buildings.
D. Post-disaster assessment – The primary objective of assessment is to provide a
clear, concise picture of the post-disaster situation, to identify relief needs, and to
develop strategies for recovery. It determ ines options for humanitarian assistance,
how best to utilize existing resources, or to develop requests fo r further assistance.
The post-disaster assessment must di stinguish among pre-disaster chronic
conditions, the needs of disaster survivors and thei r resources.
E. Emergency relief – Emergency relief is the provision, on a humanitarian basis, of
material aid and emergency medical care necessary to save and preserve human
lives. It also enables families to meet their basic needs for medical and health
care, shelter, clothing, water, and food (including the means to prepare food).
Relief supplies or services typically are pr ovided, free of charge, in the days and
weeks immediately following a sudden disaster.
F. Logistics and supply – The delivery of emergency relief will require logistical
facilities and capacity.

A well- organized supply service is  crucial for handling the
procurement or donation, storage, and dispat ch of relief supplies for distribution to
disaster victims.
G. Communication and information management – All of the above activities are
dependent on communication. There are tw o key aspects to communications in
disasters.
1. The equipment essential for informa tion flow, such as radios, telephones,
and their supporting systems of repeat ers, satellites, and transmission
lines.
 2. The information management,that is, the protocol of knowing who
communicates what information to whom, what priority is given to it, and
how it is disseminated and interpreted.
H. Survivor response and coping – In the rush to plan and execute a relief operation,
it is easy to overlook the real needs and resources of the survivors.
1. The assessment must take into account existing social coping mechanisms
that negate the need to br ing in outside assistance.
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-8 2. On the other hand, disaster survivor s may have new and special needs for
social services to help adjust to the trauma and disruption caused by the
disaster.
 3. Participation in the disaster res ponse process by individuals to aid
community organizations is a key to  healthy recovery. Through them,
appropriate coping mechanisms will be most successfully utilized.
I. Security – Security is not always a priority  issue after sudde n onset natural
disasters. Typically, it is handled by civil defense or police departments.
J. Emergency operations management – None of the above activities can be
implemented without some degree of  emergency operations management.
Policies and procedures for management re quirements need to be established well
in advance of the disaster.
K. Rehabilitation and reconstruction – Rehabilitation and rec onstruction complete
the disaster response activities and merge with the recovery phase.
II. Most communities with an emergency  response plan for earthquake disasters
include the following categories in the response plan:
[Instructor note : The following categories will be cover ed and discussed in detail during
the in-class discussion assignm ent to be covered at the end of Objective 11.6. The
relative importance of each of these can be considered and discussed in detail at that
time.

Some of the concepts, especially transpo rtation also are discussed in the following
sections that discuss recovery. ]
A. Health Services.
 B. Emergency Social Services.
 C. Law and Order.
 D. Heavy Urban Search and Rescue.
 E. Communications.
 F. Damage Assessment.
 G. Firefighting/Rescue.
 H. Transportation.
 I. Engineering and Construction.
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-9 J. Human Resources.
 K. Coroner/Mortuary.
 L. Hazardous Materials.
 M. Public Information.
 N. Food and Agriculture.
 O. Finance and Insurance.
 P. Utilities.
III. Most disaster response activities are c oordinated and conducted at the local and
state levels, but the federal government is a key player in major  disasters, as per the
Federal Response Plan :
A. This plan provides the mechanism for c oordinating delivery of federal assistance
and resources to augment efforts of st ate and local governments overwhelmed by
a major disaster.
 B. The plan is implemented in anticipation of a significant event likely to result in a
need for federal assistance or in respons e to an actual event requiring federal
assistance under a presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency (see
http://www.fema.gov/rrr/frp/).
Objective 11.4 Describe hazard management steps that promote effective earthquake
disaster response .
Requirements:
The content should be presented as lecture.
Remarks:
 I. Hazard management steps to take to promote effective earthquake disaster
response :
[Instructor note : Major portions of the following lis t were adapted from MSSC (1997) ]
A. Develop an integrated emer gency management system at all levels of government
and the private sector to protect life, health, prop erty and the environment
following an earthquake event.
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-10 B. Promote community emergency respons e teams (CERTs) statewide. Train
volunteer community emergency response teams statewide.
 C.

Support the formation, training, and funding of urban search and rescue teams.
Train and organize specialty teams designe d for intense search and rescue to
augment local fire departments during major emergencies.
 D. Promote development of emergency respons e plans at the state and local levels.
Develop comprehensive emergency response plans at state and local levels and
test plans through exercise s with first responders.
 E. Promote the selection and training of qua lified local emergency response directors
and their personnel. Establish minimum job qualifications for local emergency
response directors and develop programs for these directors and their personnel.
 F. Evaluate mass care exercise and tr aining programs for local emergency
management and volunteer agencies who respond to disasters. Evaluate and
promote coordination of current multi-agency training and exercise programs, specifically between local emergency ma nagement and voluntary agencies, under
conditions expected after earthquakes. Prom ote identification of agency mass care
roles and responsibilities in th e event of a major disaster.
 G. Expand and promote training in disast er mortuary and identify potential
temporary mortuary sites in major popul ation centers. Supp ort pre-disaster
identification of temporary mortuary s ites that can be accessed immediately in
major population centers.
H. Enhance communication capability and coordination for emergency response
between state and local governments and private groups. Develop viable
alternative means of communi cations between state and local government entities
and volunteer organizations.
 I. Enhance ability of emergency response personnel, materials, and equipment to
reach affected areas. Identify and upgrad e key transportation routes (roads, air,
rail, and water) to areas w ith a high risk of damage in the event of a major
earthquake.
 J. Promote mutual aid agreements between political subdivisions at local and state
levels. Support and encourage the estab lishment of mutual aid agreements.
 K. Promote development of effective, coor dinated response plans for utilities. Assess
and mitigate earthquake risks and damage to utilities.
 L.

Develop the capability to respond to mu ltiple hazardous materials incidents.

and develop the necessary emergency response capability.
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-11
Objective 11.5 List typical deficienci es in earthquake emergency response.
Requirements:
The content should be presented as lecture.
Remarks:
I. Emergency management and response sy stems continue to improve with each
earthquake; however, systems can be strengthened further through greater
collaboration and partnership with and between public, private, non-profit
agencies, and the community (Californi a Seismic Safety Commission [CSSC],
2003). According to CSSC, typical deficienci es in most communiti es still exist in:
A. Resources needed for better co mmunication during an event.
 B. Resources in and coordination between the public and private medical response
systems.
 C. Resources for sustained sear ch and rescue operations.
 D. Adequate and sustained resources for em ergency management at all levels of
government.
 E. Most importantly, reliable and timel y damage assessment and decision support
systems to accelerate and optimize response ac tivities. In fact, this deficiency is
important enough to focus on and list severa l impediments to the development of
knowledge and technologies that improve our ability to reliably and quickly assess
damage and optimize response resources:
1. The proprietary and/or classified natu re of the software and data needed
for rapid post-earthquake loss estimation is another barrier that must be
surmounted in order to conduct basic research and move toward the development of enabling technologie s. Many remote-sensing technologies
have been developed for intelligence and defense purposes, and it is only recently that their use in hazard management has been considered.
 2. The difficulties with developing comple te inventories of elements in the
built environment that are at risk in  order to validate advanced damage
assessment models constitute yet another set of barriers to research progress.

Inventory development is cu mbersome and expensive, and data
sources that typically serve as the basis for inventories, such as tax
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-12 assessor’s records, do not take into account all at-risk structures and
facilities.
3. Recovery decision modeling likewise is hampered by a lack of
comprehensive models that account for regional social and economic
earthquake impacts and a shortage of  data from which to construct
recovery decision support models.
 4. Implementation also is more difficu lt because of the inability of many
governmental entities to take advant age of new emergency and recovery
management tools due, for example, to lack of funds and trained personnel.
11.6 Describe innovative tools that are being de veloped to assist in response efforts.
Requirements:
The contents should be presente d as lecture. The class discus sion assignment (Handout 11.1)
should be conducted following this objective. [Instructor note : Some of this material will  also be discussed in fu ture sessions (i.e., Session 14) ]
 Handouts Included:    Handout 11.1: Classroom Discussion Assignment
Remarks:
I. Geographical information systems (GIS ) are organized collections of hardware,
software, geographic data, and personnel data designed to efficiently capture, store,
update, manipulate, analyze, and display all forms of geographically referenced
information.
A. These systems can be used with se ismic models to forecast damages for
earthquake scenarios and display the results in graphical format, such as digitized
color maps.
 B. Such data are extremely valuable for timely decision-making given a hazard
event.
 C. Some of these systems can be combined with early-warning systems to create an
almost real-time graphical display of the shaking effects in a particular region.
II. Global Positioning Systems (GPS)   are navigational systems involving satellites and
computers that can determine the latitude  and longitude of a receiver on Earth by
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-13 computing the time difference for signals fr om different satellites to reach the
receiver.
A.

Remote sensing via satellite and grou nd level (and subsurface) sensing via
seismographs brings real-time warnings of quakes and their related hazards.
 B. GPS technology can detect land movement  by monitoring changes in the position
of ground-based stations monitored by sa tellites. Satellite imagery, GPS, and
computer models also are leading to better land-use practices.
 C. For example, the World Bank is planning to  assist countries such as Honduras and
Turkey with a credit that will finance mapping of vulnerable areas, using GPS technology to help develop effective m onitoring systems to forecast natural
hazards, including earthquakes, and to plan appropriate land use.
III. Infrastructure and asset management  system  is an operational package that enables
the systematic coordinated planning and programming of investments or
expenditure, design, construction, mainte nance, rehabilitation and renovation,
operation, and in-service evaluation of physi cal facilities. The system usually is a
computer-based database of facilities. Thes e tools can be used in earthquake hazard
operations to:
A. Minimize costs.
 B. Maximize benefits.
C. Maximize safety.
 D. Minimize disturbance to daily life.
 E. Minimize response time.
 [Instructor note : conduct classroom discussion using Handout 11.1 ]
Objective 11.7 Define disaster recovery and discuss major concepts associated with
earthquake disaster recovery. Requirements:
The content should be presented as lectur e, supplemented by electronic visuals.
Electronic Visuals Included:

Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-14
Remarks:  I. Recovery  is the phase of earthquake management  that aims to restore communities
affected by disasters to a normal regime of social and economic activity. It involves
not only repairing or replacing physi cal infrastructure damaged during an
earthquake, but also rebuilding the econo mic strength and social stability of a
community through appropriate fi nancial and regulatory programs.
II.

Recovery activities consist of actions ta ken to return to (or, ideally, exceed) pre-
earthquake levels of activity and productivity.
A. These actions include restori ng, repairing, and reconstructing lifelines and
buildings , undertaking measures to overc ome earthquake-induced economic
downturns, and providing fi nancial assistance to co mpensate for losses.
 As discussed earlier in Session 7 re garding the effects of earthquakes upon
lifelines, transportation systems have an esp ecially large impact on both the
response and recovery efforts . Damage to transportation systems is
particularly important because the repai r times for these systems typically is
much longer than for other life lines, as shown in the visuals (see Chang,
2000). [Visuals 11.1, 11.2, 11.3]
Visual 11.1 – Photo of upper deck of Oakland Bay Bridge that slipped off its bearing seat
during the 1989 Loma Prieta EQ. This was a moderate structural failure (inadequate beam
seat width), but the disruption in the Bay area  was severe. More than one month was required
for repair. Photo credit: CalTrans.

Earthquake . The earthquake destroyed a 1¼-mile section of Interstate 880 . This was a major
artery in the Oakland-Alameda area ea st of San Francisco. The poor seismic
performance of this freeway promoted the en tire 5.2 mile-long section to be rebuilt. This
project was very expensive ($1.2 billion) and was not completed until September 1998,
nearly nine years after the earthquake (F HWA, 2004). Photo credit: CalTrans.
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-16 B.

The recovery period typically is the ti me in which decisions are made about
adopting new mitigation measures with the long-term objective of increasing
the earthquake resistance of the built environment  (Mileti, 1999).
III. If undertaken properly, recovery stra tegies can contain indirect and induced
earthquake losses, shorten the recovery period for affected social units, and avoid
future losses through improvements in mitigation (Mileti, 1999).
IV. Earthquake disaster recovery  involves long-term efforts to:
A. Reconstruct and restore the earthquake-stricken area , e.g. through repairing
or replacing homes, businesses, pub lic works, and other structures.
 B. Deal with the disruption that the disaster has caused  in community life and
meet the recovery-related needs of victims.
 C. Mitigate future hazards .
V. Although the four disaster phases (p reparedness, mitigation, response, and
recovery) may appear to be stages in a seque nce, they actually overlap and merge.
For example,  decisions that have an impact on ea rthquake recovery often are made
very soon after the disaster strikes, while  the emergency response is still ongoing.
 VI. In the U.S., recognition has grown that it is highly desirable to plan for recovery
before an earthquake occurs, and some comm unities (e.g., especially following the
City of Los Angeles) have begun to move  in this direction (Mileti, 1999). However,  at
present, earthquake response planning is much more extensive and more thoroughly
institutionalized than recovery planning .
VII. While we increasingly recognize that c oordinated strategies are needed to manage
recovery following major earthquakes and ot her disasters, in order to minimize
long-term negative social and economic impa cts, there is a lack of adequate data
and tools to support recovery decision-making (MCEER, 2000).
VIII. Recovery activities are related to mitigation. Effective mitigation can have a significant
effect on a community’s ability to recover swiftly from an earthquake. For example, a
high level of earthquake insurance lessens the financial burden on individuals and
governments to replace damaged property, and frees up resources that can be applied to other aspects of the recovery effort.
IX.

The recovery from a ma jor earthquake transcends jurisdictional boundaries.
A Reconstruction usually needs to be planned and carried out by groups of
jurisdictions at least at the regional  level (i.e., see ac tivities by ABAG at
http://www.abag.ca.gov/bayarea/eqmaps/eqmaps.html). Plans should be made
ahead of time for rebuild ing the infrastructure.
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-17
B. This initially entails developing an appr opriate way for exped iting the review of
applications for rebuildin g immediately after an earthquake. But beyond this,
governments should have some sense, based on a realistic earthquake
scenario, of the likely effect that a major earthquake would have on the
infrastructure. They should know which facilities would survive and which
would not, and plan accordingly.
Objective 11.8 Discuss specific r ecovery activities and issues associated with earthquake
disaster recovery planning.
Requirements:
The content should be presented as lecture.
Remarks:
I. Disaster recovery planning basically involve s asking “What ifs” to prevent later “If
onlys” (CSSC, 2000).
II. Studies have found that pre-disaster pla nning can save lives and injuries, limit
property damage, and minimize disruptio ns, enabling communities to recover more
quickly (MCEER, 2000).
III. Planning for recovery has a number of components. The following general planning
steps are adapted from the California Seismic Safety Commission Strategic Plan
(2003):
A. Planning for “Business Continuation:” Business continuation planning is aimed
at allowing an organization to resume its regular business activities as quickly as
possible after a disaster. In the case of  governments, this means being able to
continue to provide essentia l services to the public with as little disruption as
possible. This is not just a matter of  marshalling physical resources; it also
involves providing the appropriate author ities with human resources to enable
government and business to continue under extreme conditions.
 B. As with other aspects of emergency pr eparedness, business continuation planning
should be an ongoing program from which an  organization develops and modifies
its continuation plans.

And to be fully e ffective, it should involve all members of
the organization.
 C. Dealing with Building Damage: Repairing and rebuilding damaged buildings is
one element that covers the entire recove ry cycle. Initially, the concern is to
prevent further loss of life or injury, pa rticularly from aftershocks following the
initial seismic activity. Damage to stru ctures must be assessed and buildings
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-18 posted to indicate which buildings are safe  to use. A system of inspecting and
posting key buildings is therefore essentia l if injury and loss of life are to be
minimized.
D. Inspections often take the form of two main evaluations: one rapid and one
detailed:
1. A rapid evaluation is carried out to identify and post apparently safe and
obviously unsafe structures, and to de signate buildings whose strength and
safety cannot be determined without  a more thorough examination. These
evaluations usually are done by loca l building inspectors, assisted by
volunteer civil/structural engineers, ar chitects, building contractors, and
other individuals.
 2. A detailed evaluation is carried out  to evaluate and post buildings of
questionable safety, usually those th at have already been posted as
"Limited Entry." Detailed evaluations are designed to be performed by volunteer engineers within a few hours or days after the rapid evaluation
phase, and are intended to provide re asonable assurance about whether a
building can be returned to or not.
 3. The effectiveness of any post-earthq uake structural assessment program
depends on effective protocols for the assessment. As well, it depends on a
trained and accessible core of volunt eer engineers with the necessary
authority, supplies, and equipm ent to perform their function.
E. Removing Debris: A major earthquake is  likely to cause a significant amount
of damage, so debris removal is a ke y element of recovery (as well as of
response).
1. Initially, streets must be cleared quickly to allow emergency vehicles
access to help the injured and extinguish fires.
 2. Subsequently, removing what is le ft of destroyed buildings allows
reconstruction to begin earlier. The personnel and equipment of
governments and private sector companies probably will be needed to remove debris.
 3.

Suitable places to dump earthquake r ubble will have to be identified so
that environmental problems and higher future costs for cleanup can be avoided. Therefore, it is important for governments to identify potential
disposal sites in advance, and to plan  for the logistics of moving debris to
them.
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-19 4. The authority to make decisions abou t the disposition of debris should be
assigned before the event, since such decisions will have to be made quickly once the emergency has occurred.
 F. Rebuilding: Building regulations need to be es tablished to enable the rebuilding
process to proceed as quickly as possibl e. In the meantime, temporary housing
must be found for the homeless. Health and safety information must be distributed
among the population to minimize the risk of a disease outbreak resulting, for
example, from drinking contaminated water.
G. An effective rebuilding program needs to be supervised by a reconstruction
authority. Such an agency may act for a num ber of governments, and the creation
of one should be contemplated as pa rt of a long-term recovery plan.
IV. Economic Recovery:  To find out how best to revi ve the economy, impact studies
have to be carried out to identify how da maged the various elements are, what needs
repair, and how the repairs can be made . Only then can appropriate financial
assistance programs be put into place.
Objective 11.9 Discuss importan t keys to effective recovery operations so that economic
and social impact will be minimized.
Requirements:
The content should be presented as lecture.
Remarks:
I. Recovery once was viewed as a linear phenomenon, with discrete stages and end
products. Today it is seen as a process th at entails decision-making and interaction
among all stakeholders such as households , businesses, and the community at large
(MCEER, 2000).
A. Many of the decisions associated with recovery are ones of government
policy. How quickly recovery can or shoul d take place, and how the costs of
recovery will be distributed within the community, largely are determined by
government decisions. Therefore, it is important that governments give
considerable thought to the types of deci sions they will have to make and how
they will carry them out.
B.

Recovery appears to be most effect ive when community-based organizations
assume principal responsibility, suppl emented by outside technical and
financial assistance (Mileti, 1999). Perhaps a further shift will be needed – away
from an exclusive focus on restoring damaged structures  toward effective
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-20 decision-making  at all levels. Outside technical  assistance can help strengthen
local organizational and decision- making capacity (Mileti, 1999).
II. According to MCEER (2003) and MSSC ( 1997), additional general measures key to
effective  earthquake disaster recovery  are:
A. Provide Accurate and Timely Information: Establish a coordinated public
information strategy to provide accurate and timely recovery and mitigation information to public and private se ctors through all available means.
 B. Identify suitable, earthquake resistant  short- and long-term shelters and
coordinate agreements for their use.
1. Earthquake resistant  short- and long-term sh eltering facilities (think
about aftershocks) are required following a major disaster.
 2. Plan for the construction of l ong-term temporary housing. Develop
contingency plans for the location, de sign and construction of long-term
temporary housing. Long-term temporary housing will be needed for victims displaced by a major earthquake.
C. Promote funding and training of  post-earthquake building inspection
volunteers.
1. Continue to train volunteers througho ut the jurisdiction to make rapid
visual examinations of buildings.
2. By using a system already in plac e for training, certifying, and mobilizing
volunteers, structures that  are safe for occupancy can be rapidly identified
after an earthquake or other disaster . This will permit housing and jobs to
be quickly restored.
D. Enhance the ability of individuals and small businesses to recover from an
earthquake disaster.
1. Enable small businesses to recove r from an earthquake and to access
funding at the federal and state levels in a timely manner so that economic
recovery progresses.
 2.

For instance, develop guidelines to accelerate the permitting and
rebuilding process so that disrupti on of individuals and businesses is
minimized, rapid personal and economi c recovery is assured, and the
adverse economic impact of an earthqua ke will be reduced in the affected
area.
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-21 E. Support identification of facili ties and methods for disposal of
uncontaminated debris and hazardous ma terials from collapsed structures.
Prepare a plan for disposal of hazardous materials, contaminated and
uncontaminated debris. Coordination w ill result in improved and efficient,
coordinated disposal of hazardous ma terials and uncontaminated debris.
F. Enhance ability to provide crisis counse ling to individuals in affected areas.
Develop a network of trained counsel ors who will respond to and provide
counseling to residents in affected ar eas. Residents, particularly children,
probably will have trouble understanding and coping with the emotional trauma
following a major earthquake.
Objective 11.10 Describe typical deficiencies  in earthquake recovery activities and
operation.
Requirements:
The content should be presented as lecture. Th e homework should be distributed following the
completion of this objective. Handouts Included:    Handout 11.2 -Homework Assignment 11.2
Remarks:
I. Recovery methods have improved with ea ch earthquake; however, there are still a
number of deficiencies that  impair effective and speedy recovery and have resulted
in unacceptable levels of personal and financial loss (Mileti, 1999).
II. According to Mileti (1999), deficiencies typically exist in:
A. Funding for effective management of the recovery process (including mitigation).
 B. Adequate interim shelter and housing, part icularly for those with special needs.
 C. Plans and resources to accommodate in terim and long-term and post-earthquake
housing..
 D. Adequate knowledge and preparation by the public, business, and service sectors
for effective recovery.
III. Recovery planning has been given less than adequate attention in the context of
overall earthquake planning (Mileti, 1999).
Session 11: Earthquake Disaster Response and Recovery
Earthquake Hazard and Emer gency Management 11-22 A.

Failure to plan for recovery can mean that the recovery process may take much
longer than otherwise might be required.
 B. The lack of recovery planning weakens a community’s ability to plan for
effective mitigation , as the potential costs of economi c and social restoration will
not be known with any accuracy.
C. While it is difficult to assign a value to human life, communities and the
public will want to know the cost-benefit implications of different ways to mitigate purely economic risks.
D. Prolonged economic instability makes it difficult for the community to regain its
former competitive advantages, and can hold back the rate at which the economy
is rebuilt.
IV. Local leaders too often fail to take advantage of the reco very period to reshape their
devastated communities to withstand future events (Mileti, 1999).
A. Most local disaster plans need to be extended, not only to explicitly address
recovery and reconstruction, but also to  identify opportunities for rebuilding in
safer ways and in safer places.
B. Again,  as noted above, the recovery period following one disaster is often a
time for considering how to mitigate losses!!
